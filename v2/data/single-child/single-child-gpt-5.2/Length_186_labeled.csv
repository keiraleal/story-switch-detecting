in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: they came home from school .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: <mhm> [>] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and> [<] their mom said that they were gonna go out to eat .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: mhm .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and she said where do you wanna go ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and <they> [/?] Lisa and Raymond shouted out Mcdonalds .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: uhhuh .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then their mom <drove to Mcdonalds and> [/?] drove to Mcdonalds .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then they got inside .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: <mhm> [>] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and> [<] they were walking inside .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then they got inside .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: Raymond knew what he wanted to eat .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and his mom <know what he wanted> [/?] knew what she wanted to eat .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and> [/?] but Lisa didn't know what to order .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay [>] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <she> [<] thought and thought about it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then she ordered <a happy meal> [/?] &*INV:mhm a happy meal <a chocolate cone> [/?] a chocolate icecream &*INV:mhm and a chocolate milkshake <um &~th> [/?] and a happy meal .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the clerk said it would be twelve fifty .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and &-um (7.) +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you remember anything else ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then she reached down to her purse .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and she couldn't find it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then she realized she left it at home on the counter .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: this guy's name is gonna be Ron .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay [>] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <sorry> [<] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: Ron &*INV:mhm woke up one morning .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: at +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: Ron was asleep um xxx xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: no that's okay .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: look at the pictures and see what he's doing .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: Ron woke up .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he figured out that he overslept when his alarm went .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: next he went downstairs and poured his cereal .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but he wasn't looking at his thing when he was doing the cereal .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: he looked at the clock .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <then he then he then he um> [/?] then he spilled <all> [/?] almost all of the milk that he had poured in the bowl .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then he hadta clean it up .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: next he went upstairs and got dressed .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and> [>] then <&~h> [/?] he started to tie his shoe .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: <mhm> [<] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <he &~w> [/?] he was tying his shoe when all of a sudden the string broke .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then <he like> [/?] he hadta tie it with a little tiny weeny string .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then he was all ready to go .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then he missed the bus .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: so he hadta walk all the way to school .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then when he gotta school he saw his teacher outside .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he was tardy .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so Ron was really having a bad day .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you looking at the picture ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: the boy's name is gonna be David .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: the girl's name is gonna be lily .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: okay .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: lily not xxx .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <David and xxx xxx lily> [/?] David and lily were walking in the park .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and they saw a big saucer coming .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: um I forgot his name already .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <David> [/?] &*INV:mhm David said look at that saucer .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: <mhm> [<] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <so &~l> [/?] so lily look at that saucer .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: they thought it could be <like> [/?] a big meteorite instead .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: it started slowing down when it came to the earth .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then it came down <and landed> [/] and landed on the earth .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then <a door> [/] a door came flying down .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: then David and lily knew that it was an alien <&~saush> [/?] saucer .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <so then they> [/] so then they <went and> [/] went and hid behind some <brushes> [/?] brushy bushes and <&~pee> [/?] peered over the top .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and [/] and they saw the door open .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then they saw these little figures coming out .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they saw one leg two leg three legs four legs five legs <&~a> [/?] lots_of legs coming out_of the things .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they knew that it would be alien .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: &-um so the aliens +...
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so they hid because they have all these little dots over them .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and they look like chickenpox .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and they had this weird dog an alien dog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then they land .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then lily started to run over to try to meet them .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: but [/] but David said no wait they could hurt us .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: they're not from our land .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: they're from mars I think or from another galaxy .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so +...
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <but Elaina didn't> [/?] but lily didn't pay any attention .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: she just kept on trying to meet them .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <and then> [/] and then <Elaina finally> [/?] lily finally listened .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: she didn't go to meet them because they looked weird .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but they had <good> [/?] nice smiles .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so then they went home .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and so they> [/?] and so the next day they came back .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the aliens also were still there .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and so they wondered why it would stay here .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and they wondered <where the people were where the> [/?] where the aliens were .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and they looked all around .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then they finally saw that they were eating the picnic .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then they [/] they watched them go and play on the playground .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then they fell asleep .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so Elaina and David <&~l> [/?] looked in the alien saucer .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: looked like nothing was there .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: except on the other side there was probably something .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they went in and looked on the other side .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they saw that there was nothing .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and they saw this big red button .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and so they> [/?] and then they saw all these weird <things> [/?] curves on the side .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <so they xxx> [/?] so they knew that at last they hadta push the red button <for the stuff> [/] for the stuff like the chair <to be um> [/?] to be and the guns and all the other stuff .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <&~s> [/?] and so_that they now roll why <that that &-um that> [/?] that's where <the> [/?] all the stuff went .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so now they know that <that> [/?] they're hiding it because they don't want anybody to take off in their ship while they're still here .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: mhm .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: so that's why they hid it .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so then right when they got out they hid in the bushes again .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: then they were starting to wake up .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then they went back on their alien saucer and went back and got some drinks .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and [/] and then they came back out .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and there> [/] and there they saw the weird dog again .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and there was many many many legs and those green spots on their faces .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and then> [/] and then Elaina jumped up from behind the brush and started to run towards the aliens again .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: but David said no no no no wait wait .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: we don't know any of them .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and Elaina didn't pay any attention .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: so she just kept on trying to meet them .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then David pulled her back .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and she fell on her bottom .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so did David .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then they went over and had a picnic .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then they went back into the playground .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and they took a nap .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and they keeps on going over and over again .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and that's all .
