in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and the next day he woke up and he said +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" uhoh [!] there's no frog there !"
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he looked all over his room .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the dog got his head stuck in the jar .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and then he started calling +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: at least on the front page that was what it said .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then he still had the jar stuck on his head here .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then the dog falls out_of the window .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and then he's angry> [//] and then the little boy's angry at the dog .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he's calling +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: again .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and &-um &-um in this picture he's seeing if he's in a gopher hole .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and &-um the dog's jumping up <at a> [/] at a &-um beehive .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: on the next one a gopher comes out and bites him it looks like .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he's still trying to get the bee hive .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then he knocks down the bee hive .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <and the little boy> [//] while the little boy is looking in the tree .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: the little boy gets down because the bees a flying straight towards the dog !
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then &-um a crow flies .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I think that's what it is +...
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: a crow flies right over .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and he sees his frog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he thinks these are branches .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he holds on to them calling +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: but it is really a reindeer .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he's running and running and running .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and they go over into a pond I think .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and they go +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" aah !"
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: splat .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and he gets stuck in the pond .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then <there's the> [/] there's the dog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then the dog's stuck on top of his head .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he said +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" ssh ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: to the dog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he looks over .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and there are <two frogs> [/] two frogs .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and one of them is his frog .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he says +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" there are all the little frog babies !"
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and I think he found another one .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: at least that is what it looks like .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the end .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: the boy's calling frog where are you ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and the dog> [//] it looks like the dog is probably scared because he doesn't wanna fall off the log .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and &-um there's the frog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www +/.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: oh [!] and the reason that he's calling for the frog is because &-um <he's> [//] <because what do you call it> [//] because he lost his frog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: first page .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: one night a little boy was sitting on a stool next_to his bed .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then there's a dog that was feeling +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: &-um I wonder what the dog was feeling +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I think he wanted to eat the frog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: he was feeling like he wanted to eat the frog ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it looks that way .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the little boy was happy .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and so was the frog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the frog <crept out_of the> [/] crept out_of the jar .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: I think he was feeling happy .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: those two felt very sleepy .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the next morning they woke up and no frog !
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: no frog there .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: <they were both feeling> [//] he was feeling +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" oh no [!] bad !"
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he [//] the doggy +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it doesn't give me enough information +...
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and &-um the doggy gets his head stuck in the jar .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the boy's looking all over the place .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and I think he's feeling sort of &-um +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: what do you call it +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: well whatever you call it +...
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: I thinks feeling a little squished .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: squished ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the boy's still feeling unhappy .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he's feeling scared because he thinks he's gonna fall off .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he's still unhappy .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: and he's screaming +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: at least I can tell from the cover .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then the dog falls out the window .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: <and the> [//] and &-um he's like +""/."
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" whoops !"
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then he's mad at the dog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the glass jar that was around his head went zzz .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: crack .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: he's mad at the dog .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and <then he's> [//] again he's calling +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the boy is feeling still unhappy .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and the dog's like +""/."
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" zzz ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he's trying to catch the bees .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: I guess that's what he's doing +...
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and he goes over to a gopher hole .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the frog is jumping at &-um <the bee's net> [//] &-um the <bee's> [//] bee whatever it is .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and &-um he is looking in a gopher hole .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and he's probably calling +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" frog are you in there ?"
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then the gopher jumps out and bites him in the nose .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: it looks like he's feeling bad .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog is still trying to get the bee hive .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: what might he be saying here ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" ouch ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,"JOA: +"" ouch ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: &-um and the boy went up to look into a tree .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and he's probably calling +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" frog are you in there ?"
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and &-um and the dog knocked down the bee hive .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it looks like all the bees are trying to get him now .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then the boy jumped off the tree and went straight down because the bees were going like strings like an arrow <at him> [//] at the dog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and I wonder why the dog is running away like that .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: because he doesn't wanna be stung by the bees .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and &-um here he's dodging the owl .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: now that I've thought about it .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he's walking up here .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he's calling +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" frog where are you ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and that's on this page too .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: that's on this page .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he's holding on to some what he thinks are branches .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: it is really some kind of deer's &-um &-um horns .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the deer goes zzz .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and lifts him up .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then the deer runs .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the dog is running too .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <and &-um they> [//] and then the deer stops zzz really fast .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the boy goes flying off .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog goes zzz into the lake just like he does .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he is definitely not feeling good .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the boy and the +...
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and that's <the> [//] a picture of him in the lake .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and there they're like zzz .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and then he's like +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" okay let's get on with the search ."
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOA: now let's get on with the search he says .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and I wonder why he's holding his hand up to his ear .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: oh because he hears &-um the frogs <chirp-ing or whatever they do> [//] croaking .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and then he says +""/."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: +"" look [!] ssh !"
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: they're creeping up behind the log .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then he jumps over the log with the dog .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then he sees <the two> [//] <the dog and> [//] <I mean> [//] his frog and some other frog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: and he says +""/."
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" oh froggy !"
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: how does the boy feel there ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he feels <happy> [//] excited .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog's like zzz .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and he's like +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" what the heck <are going> [//] is going on here ?"
in,FALSE,TRUE,"JOA: the dog's thinking +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"JOA: +"" what the heck is going on here ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then he finds another frog over here .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: a little small frog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I think it's a baby .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the end .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: is he saying anything to the frogs ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: +"" I found another one ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"JOA: he's saying to them +""/."
in,TRUE,FALSE,"JOA: +"" I found another one ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or something like that maybe .
