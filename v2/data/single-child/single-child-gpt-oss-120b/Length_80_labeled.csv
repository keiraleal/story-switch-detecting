in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and I [?] never know where it is .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you oughta have learnt where it is by now .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: sometimes I know where it is when I jump up it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I do jumps up it .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so that's the stunts you can do .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you stay in the garden when you're riding it ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: yes , sometimes [/] sometimes in the summer I ride it ."
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: or sometimes I swim in the swimming pool I've got .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"INV: oh lovely , but not with the bike ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: &=laughs .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: don't put a bike in the swimming pool .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: who do you ride it with then ?

out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: well it's not bad for a girl .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and she> [/] she she +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but I sometimes jump up the slope .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: there's a slope like that .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and I go up it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: and <there's> [/] well , there's bumps at the top of it ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and I ride down the hill .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and I go wheee@o and jump straight down the hill .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what's at the end of the hill then ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the end of the slope .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the end of the hill is [/] is a bend .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: but I sometimes go straight over the jump , straight down and go into the garages ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: sometimes I can't stop and ride straight into the garages .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or sometimes I go up the curb .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: but can't you damage your bike like that if you go into the garages ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but sometimes I tur [//] skid round so I sometimes flop .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or if I go into the curb I try and bunny+hop up it .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you try and do what ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: bunny+hop up it or +/.
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what's that ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how do you bunny+hop ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you ride xxx .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: jump [//] try and do a jump with both wheels off the ground and move and land .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or I [/] I put my front wheel on top of a curb .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then my back wheel goes [//] just goes straight up .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you do races on it ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah , <I somet> [//] and I know where there is two proper b_m_x tracks ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: where ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: Wareham [?] Wood .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: but one isn't quite in the wood .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <it's> [/] it's not far away from my house .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: it [/] it's by Mortimer [?] „ they are .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: what do you on the b_m_x tracks , the proper tracks ?"
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: <the the one some> [//] one is a race , where you race round it ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: like you go round a bow .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: you ride round like that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: yeah .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: with other people ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah , you ride it round like that ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: then you go up a bump , table+top ."
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: then you go round another mound .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then you go round another one .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then you go round another bump .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then you go up to a bump .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <I can> [/] I can <jump up> [//] go up that one and jump over the second one .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and about that far away from each_other +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: yeah .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: +, I go like that ."
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: but sometimes my back wheel xxx on the last bump .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then you hafta round the mini [/] mini burn up [/] up to the starting line .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you go round like that and up like that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: yeah .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so you start up there and go down like that .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but [//] and there's a speed jump where <you put> [//] just the front wheel goes up in the air .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is there someone there to time you when you're going round ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: my sister does it , (be)cause <she's got> [/] she's got a proper time watch ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: has she , a stop watch ?"
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: are you good at that ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what's the other track like ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: <it's> [//] most of it's jumps .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but <there is a> [/] there is a kind of course .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <you kind of go> [//] you can go backw(ard) go one xxx .
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: like you go downhill and up a jump , turn round there <and down> [//] and straight , down a big slope ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: then you go round there and down there and up a big hill .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: and you can go up [//] down a big hill , round there and do a jump up the slope there and turn round there and jump round the jump ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: but when do you do that ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you it in the winter as_well ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I sometimes do it in the winter .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <or someti> [//] but I often do it on saturdays and sundays or sometimes for a little while when I get home from school .

out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: did you ride your bike when it was snowing ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: no , <I did ri> [/] I did ride my bike ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but I made a [/] a jump out_of snow to ride up .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: that's a good idea .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what happened when it melted and you didn't have anything to jump over ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: except for the bump .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: and d(o) you make a snowman ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: did you ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah , xxx [>] ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: xxx [<] .

out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: that's not very clever .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: on purpose ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yes .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: or by accident ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: on purpose .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <I was I> [//] I saw it xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: that's not very nice .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: your sister couldn't have been very pleased .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: but I built it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so it was your snowman .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah , (be)cause <I made> [//] <I rolled> [/] I rolled a snowball that big ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it ended up that big .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: yeah .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and [/] and then I made a head .
