in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: in the beginning &-um the little boy found a frog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: he fell asleep .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the frog slipped away .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the next morning he looked for him .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he couldn't find him .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: he looked everywhere .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he looked in his boots .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: dog looked in the glass .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: <the dog> [//] &-um the little boy went out and &-um cried for his frog and yelled hey frog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog kind of <get> [//] slipped and <fell> [//] cracked the glass that the frog was in that his head was in .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the little boy went outside and got him .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: he was real annoyed at him .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and so they went outside .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and they started calling for him .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so I guess they went into the woods .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: the little boy looked in the mole hole <and> [//] where he saw him get out .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the dog barked at &-um the bee hive .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy thought it was really stinky in there .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it smelled .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and <the> [/] the dog still thought that that was some kind of harmful thing .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then he must have shook the tree .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it fell down and cracked open .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy is looking inside the tree to see .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and as you can see it was an owl's tree .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog was up there .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then a bunch of bees start chasing the dog because their hive is broken .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then the owl like swooped away .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy climbs this really high rock and calls for his frog .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then the &-um <branches> [//] <well> [//] the deer's antlers that he thought was branches that he was holding onto was actually a deer's antlers .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the deer hauled up .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he started running .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog started barking and running after him .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then he stopped right here .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then the little boy and the dog fell off of the little ledge there and fell into the pond .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: splash !
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then they didn't really mind .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then they started to hear the frogs .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: xxx .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so he told the dog to be quiet .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and they'll sneak up on them .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and sure enough what do they see ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: two frogs that loved each_other .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and they had children .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and so the frogs gave the little boy one of their frogs .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and that's the end of the story .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: well it looks like the dog is really scared because &-um they're on a log .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he's not really sure that they should go there .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: the little boy is really like sad that he can't find his dog and like depressed .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: mhm .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and <he's probably> [/] he's probably lonely .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and he's probably yelling &-um frog where are you ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: www .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: &-um <they're probably> [//] he's probably confused and pretty like you know .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then the little boy's really happy that he got this <pet> [/] pet frog .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he just has a dog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <he's probably kind of happy that> [//] &-um he's probably like just smiling because he's gonna get out_of there soon .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: so he's confused and he's smiling because he's gonna get out soon and he's +...
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: really happy that he got a frog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: okay great .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and why ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: because he got the frog .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then the frog jumped out because he was not in his natural habitat <and> [//] while the little boy and the dog were sleeping .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and why ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: because he wasn't in his natural habitat .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: <and then the little boy and the dog> [//] the dog probably is like where did he go ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: the little boy is probably like really sad .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: if I had any noises in here it would be like zzz .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: what kind of noise would that be ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: snoring .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and &-um why ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: because the same thing here which was the frog wasn't in his natural habitat .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he was really scared that he wasn't there .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy was like really sad that he can't find him .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and he thought that he was in his boots or something .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog is like where's the frog ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: did he shrink ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy is probably really scared .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: he's probably screaming and everything .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the dog looks a little off balance like yikes !
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and what is he saying ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: froggie come back !
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: now he's like &-um really really really scared right here .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he cracked this .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: he's like yikes !
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he's probably like what ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and this is probably when the dog thinks oh my big hero !
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the little boy is probably saying things under his breath .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and how does he feel ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: mainly like annoyed at the dog .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and how did this happen ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: &-um the dog fell out_of the window .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then we have &-um the dog is like really +...
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I just noticed something .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: what ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: where is his other hand ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it should be right here .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: it does seem to be missing doesn't it ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: now what's happening ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: well the dog's really suspicious of the little flies or bees .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and the little boy is <like instead of annoyed he's> [//] really scared again .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: he's probably saying froggie come back .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then the dog is like I found you now !
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the dog goes zzz .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and the boy probably thinks froggie are you there ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: requests that child speak up a bit .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: pretty much .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: great .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: now what's happening ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: the little boy thought it was really stinky .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and then probably this little mole is probably saying you stinking animal stay out_of my house !
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: the next time you can knock !
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and what's he saying ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: www .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and he's probably doing the same thing here only more suspicious that time .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: he's more suspicious that time ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah this one he's like uhoh spaghettio .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and then all these bees are like ah: get him !
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and probably the little boy is like froggie you must be in there .

out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOA: and why is the dog running away so quickly ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: because all the bees are chasing him .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so he's probably like help me [!] nine one one help me !

in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and he fell down and was like ah: gravity still works .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: and here he's like uhoh this isn't funny !
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: you'll regret this !
