in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: it's [<] a good book but I think it's sad .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MOT: mm can I have a napkin please ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: because the boy (.) is being greedy .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MOT: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: &-um he asks for everything .

out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: mhm [<] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: mostly Pacific [/] &-uh Pacific island cultures do that .
in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: only that's not a commonplace thing .
in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: +^ usually when they make boats they make them like rafts .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: mhm .
in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: no other cultures +...
in,FALSE,FALSE,FAT: I mean like &-uh you know (.) just the average person would not make a boat out_of a tree trunk .
