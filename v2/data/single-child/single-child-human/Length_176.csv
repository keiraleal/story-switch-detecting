in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it is [^ ic] a lizard that gets [^ rc] like kind of a beard .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but it is [^ ic] really long spikes .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you feed it a mouse ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no it is [^ ic] like a regular lizard .

out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I forgot [^ ic] what it is [^ nom] called .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you remember the story ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: yeah, it was [^ ic] called marty the bear ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what happened in the story ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: he kept on trying [^ ic] to find a different house .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then at the end he found [^ ic] the same house .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but and &-um he he fixed [^ ic] it up because he broke [^ avc] a lot of things .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then he had [^ ic] to find a new house .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and one of them were [^ ic] a cave which had [^ rc] a dragon in it .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: when he went into the cave, was he afraid when he saw the dragon ?"
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no he went [^ ic] to sleep in it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and once he woke [^ avc] up his tail was [^ ic] on fire .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so he ran [^ ic] out .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now do you want to ask me any questions ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no .
out,FALSE,FALSE,@G: Chess_Con
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how long have you played chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: about three years, four ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I don't know [^ ic] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how old were you when you first started to play .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhh about five .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: and who taught you how to play chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no one .

out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yes .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: which one ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is there a name to the chess club ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it is [^ ic] just more or less her chess club .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so it is at your school .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how often do you play chess say in a typical week .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I play [^ ic] it on mondays .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how long are you there for an hour two hours .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it is [^ ic] three fifteen to four fifteen .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: well today is monday .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: should you be in chess ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: normally now I do not go [^ ic] to chess but I used to .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: who do you play with the most ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: &-uh I do not have [^ ic] someone to play with the most because the teachers decide [^ avc] who to play with .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: we always play with a different person [^ ic] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: can you name any famous chess players .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhh no .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you ever play chess on a computer .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: can you tell me about that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what is it like ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,"CHI: well, &-uh I have [^ ic] a game that is [^ rc] on the internet ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it has [^ ic] a couple games on it .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and it has [^ ic] chess on it .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how often do you play that ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: not very often .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but I like [^ ic] her star wars chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: stuff like that .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: I play [^ ic] that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you play with your brother and sister ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me why you enjoy chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: umm well it is [^ ic] just a fun game, fun to do ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you it is [^ ic] a quiet time .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it is [^ ic] not all loud because everyone is [^ avc] concentrating on the game .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you like peace and quiet .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: sometimes I like [^ ic] loudness .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and sometimes I like [^ ic] peace and quiet .
out,FALSE,FALSE,@G: Chess_Expo
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: I am not to familiar with the game of the chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you probably know a lot more about it than I do .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: I would like you to explain some things to me .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: first of all how many people may play a game of chess at one time ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: a lot of people because there are [^ ic] different kinds of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or are you talking [^ ic] about just the regular kind of chess ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: the regular kind of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: only two people could play [^ ic] at a time .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how about the not regular .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: the not regular is [^ ic] a lot because every there are [^ avc] a couple of people on both teams .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they are [^ ic] all on a line .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: and every time there is [^ avc] a turn, they move [^ ic] a piece ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how many people play in that ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: more than six ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: have you heard of simultaneous matches .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: there is [^ ic] a knight which moves [^ rc] in like an l shape or a seven shape .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and there is [^ ic] the pawn that can only move [^ rc] one but in their first move that can move [^ rc] two .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: there is [^ ic] the rook which can only move [^ rc] forward or side to side or backwards .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and there is [^ ic] the queen which can basically do [^ rc] anything but the horse move .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: and huhh, umm and oh yeah and then there is [^ ic] the king which you have [^ rc] to protect ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it moves [^ ic] one space every direction .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and uhh there is [^ ic] the bishop that moves [^ rc] like that .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but they can move [^ ic] like that once .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and that is [^ ic] all the pieces .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me about the goals of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: in other words what are the players trying to do ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: well there is [^ ic] different kind of goals .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: is [^ ic] it just the main chess still ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: alright you have [^ ic] to try to checkmate the king with your pieces .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: that is [^ ic] your main goal .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: okay and if that happens, if you checkmate the other person, what happens ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: umm then the game is [^ ic] over .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: the game is over ?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: wherever it got checkmated [^ avc] it loses [^ ic] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: in other words tell me everything you can think about the game of chess so that never played before would know how to play .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: well, I would like [^ ic] to show the rules on the board ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: it would take [^ ic] a long long time discussing all of the rules .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: basically every move you cannot do [^ rc] it with a piece is [^ ic] against the rules .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: and uhh like you only can attack [^ ic], capture, one piece at a time unless there is [^ avc] special way that someone made up [^ rc] ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I just forgot [^ ic] all of the other rules .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so maybe if we pretend [^ avc] we have [^ nom] a board here you could explain [^ ic] it to me .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: like if there was [^ avc] a couple pawns in like a line, you can not move [^ ic] them all at the sme time ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you can only move [^ ic] one piece at a time .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: once you move [^ avc] a piece and then take on your hand off, that is [^ ic] your move ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you can not [^ ic] take it back .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: and there is [^ ic] like touch move and stuff .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I do not like [^ ic] touch move .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what is touch move .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: if you touch [^ avc] a piece, then you have [^ ic] to move it ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you can't put your hand and think and then take it off ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you can [^ ic] .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: if you just like on accident touch [^ avc] it, then they they say [^ ic] you touched [^ nom] it so ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so is that all the rules basically ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yes, the main rules ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now I would like you to tell me what the players should do in order to win the game .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: in other words, what are some key strategies that every good player should know ."
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: well my good strategy is [^ ic] make [^ nom] a wall with my pawns .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: I set [^ ic] my good good pieces up and take like all my pawn, get it captured ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then my pawns took [^ ic] out a whole bunch of other pieces .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so I checkmate [^ ic] the king with my other good pieces .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but I lose [^ ic] a couple of good pieces on the way .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but I don't [^ ic] .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I only castle [^ ic] with my king .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: oh yeah, there is [^ ic] another rule umm ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you can not castle [^ ic] with your rook and your king when your king is [^ avc] in check .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and you can not [^ ic] castle .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then your castle is [^ ic] in danger from the piece .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: you can not do [^ ic] that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what is castle ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: it is [^ ic] a rook .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: like say the king and the rook <have, haven't> [//] hasn't [^ ic] moved ."
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the pieces are [^ ic] out of the way .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: one will the king will go [^ ic] here .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then the rook will go [^ ic] here .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: so basically, it helps [^ ic] protect them ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how long does it usually take to play a game of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: well, between two &-um like masters, it would take [^ ic] a couple of hours ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: maybe just an hour .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: a normal game would be [^ ic] not very long .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: fifteen minutes maybe .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah, maybe ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: well normally, like five ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what make a game last a long time ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: uhh people like [/] like do not make [^ ic] a move .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: they keep on thinking [^ ic] about moves .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I always see [^ ic] a better move .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: sometimes that .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what makes a game end quickly ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: everyone likes [^ ic] moving really fast .
in,FALSE,TRUE,"CHI: once I am done [^ avc] with our tournament, I just move [^ ic] the piece ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what is your style ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: I like doing it [^ ic] kind of medium fast .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you know how to use a chess clock ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,"CHI: yeah, I was [^ avc] never taught so I kind of know [^ ic] but not really ."
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: can you tell me what a typical day is like in your chess club ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: when you went to the chess club .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: like what did you do in your chess club .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: what does [^ ic] typical mean ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: like the usual .
out,FALSE,FALSE,"INV: you show up, your coach tells you a new strategy ."
in,TRUE,TRUE,CHI: I just sitdown [^ ic] and play someone .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: they did not teach you a strategy every week .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: no they do not [^ ic] .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is there anything else you want to tell me about chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: nothing else .
