out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me why you enjoy chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhm I do not know
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: I'm not too familiar with the game of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: you probably know a lot more about it than I do .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: so I'd like you to explain some things to me .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: first of all
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhm four .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: not on one board
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and xxx wait I forget what that is [^ ic] called .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: I've heard of simultaneous matches .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: that is what that is [^ ic] called xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: tell me about the different pieces and how they are supposed to move .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do they go straight ahead or diagonal ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: not diagonal
in,FALSE,FALSE,INV: like an l shape .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and bishops can go [^ ic] diagonal .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and on your first move with a pawn
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but the rest you have to go [^ ic] one .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: your first move you can move two spaces ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and kings one space any direction .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and the queen all through the board any direction .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and with the knights xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: the little short pieces ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: alright and knights can jump [^ ic] other pieces .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: xxx and knights xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me about the goals of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: in other words
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhm capture the king and checkmate .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now tell me the rules that players need to follow .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: in other words
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: uhm there is touch rule xxx .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and so if you touch a piece you have [^ ic] to play .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: xxx and you touch another piece if its legal you have [^ ic] to take it .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhm that is [^ ic] all I can think of right now .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: those are pretty important rules aren't they ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: now I would like you to tell me what a player should do in order to win the game of chess .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: in other words
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: if you get [^ avc] your pawn down to the other side
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but it doesn't it cannot be [^ ic] a pawn .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: or it cannot be [^ ic] a king .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: if you get [^ avc] your pawn down to the other side without being taken
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and you can have [^ ic] two queens on the board .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is that a good strategy ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and uhm if you do not lose [^ avc] any of your pawns and you get them all down
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and if you if you get [^ avc] a pawn down and you can flip one of the rooks over and that is [^ ic] a queen .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and you get another one down you can flip another rook over and then you got two queens .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and then xxx .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you get and then you get [^ ic] all seven pawns down you can have [^ ic] eleven queens .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is that great ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: but with two or one then you get [^ ic] checkmate .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: you just have to get [^ ic] it to the side your on and then here is [^ ic] a king
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: how long does it usually take to play a game of chess ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: uhm if an inexperienced player is [^ avc] playing
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and an experienced player is [^ ic] playing it can go [^ ic] up to four hours at least .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what makes a game last a long time ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: uhm not winning his pieces .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: cause if you are [^ avc] winning his pieces
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: yeah .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what makes a game end quickly be short ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: you lose your pieces very [^ ic] quickly .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and if you up pieces
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: trading ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: take [^ ic] a bishop for a bishop xxx .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: so you should do [^ ic] that if you are [^ avc] ahead of the game .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: do you know how to use a chess clock ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: child nods head .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: tell me about it .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: uhm if it is your turn [^ avc] and you make a move
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: so then it will [^ ic] pop up a light or pop up something that will tell the other player .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and if they do not hit [^ avc] the clock
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and if it goes out
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: if they do not say flag [^ avc] xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: is there anything else you want to tell me about chess ?
in,TRUE,FALSE,CHI: uhm en passant .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: what is that ?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: that is when you are [^ ic] in fifth rank .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: and a pawn is here [^ ic] and another pawn here .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: black pawn here [^ ic] xxx .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CHI: but originally xxx .
out,FALSE,FALSE,INV: anything else you want me to know about ?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CHI: nope .
