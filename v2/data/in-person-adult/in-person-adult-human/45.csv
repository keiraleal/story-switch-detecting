out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: ʔOw.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Is he still a virgin?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Just out of curiosity.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: he bought a hooker.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: But w:as he a virgin when you knew him?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I meant has he ever had a girl where he didn't have to p:ay her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Oh % laugh oh % laugh he got like I told you about the time he got like a blowjob at the lakefront.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: No you didn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Oh no way.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PATR: Um well what happened was I was just ʔuh me and Janine well let me back up here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I started hanging out with Janine Janine and I got s:mashed and we like made out at the lakefront.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I don't need the details.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: By the way I saw the Janine last night.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Oh cool how's she doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I haven't seen her in half a billion years so um: but anyways we were like making out and stuff at Duncan lakefront so that's what we regularly well not regularly did this like th- two three times something like that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So after Victor's after Tom had two women like fighting over who he's gonna go home with he went home with this like uh one other girl like a heavy girl and me and Janine and all of us were walking dow:n the hill.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know going dow:n where the pier is?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Except we were going down that big hill?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: And it's like uh me and Janine were used to walking down that steep grassy part and they went around.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So we hurried up and went in the grassy part by: the tennis courts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: It was real dark and you couldn't see us at all after we had gotten to that little plank.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So we like hurried up to this one spot we always went to we sat and looked around and Tom and them were yelling and screaming for us.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know and they started making out like a hundred yar:ds away from us.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know but there's trees and they were standing in front of a tree so you couldn't see them and we were sitting by like a tree so you couldn't see us.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So they were making out and we're sitting there talking and stuff and junk and then it's like all of a sudden we hear and that was just the damnedest noise and a very distinctive noise.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: so I'm like I know they're not doing what I think they're doing and we're looking around the corner I couldn't see anything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: And then all of a sudden I saw: Tom I don't know took a step back or something and I could see Tom.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Or something I don't n- know on: this side of the tree and then I saw a head.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Or a movement lower than what I saw Tom.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So then the picture became clear that he's getting ʔuh head from this chick he didn't even know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: And that was kinda cool.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So I don't know: if he.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: So did he do her or did he just get the blowjob.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Just the blowjob.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: It's like it was getting late and she had to work in the morning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: But and that's the first chick I ever saw him with here in the United States otherwise.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: He's only paid for it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Did he pay for it back home?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Yeah fifty bucks for hookers well it's kind of a good price I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,PATR: nowadays here you'd have to like you know pay fifty bucks to go out to dinner and a movie and then: you have to be ʔuh real nice and then maybe just may:be something mi:ght happen i:f she likes you and if the wind's blowing in the right directio:n and just no one tripped over anything earlier in that day and well take fifty bucks go get a hooker and then go out with your friends and have some fun.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Or you could always go down to: that one strip in Chicago.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: What strip.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: The one over ʔuh ʔuh by Crowbar?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: No?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: It's like by the bridge?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Okay what what's what ah
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: There's like a whole strip.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: That's like that whole strip right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: There's all the
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: ʔuh the classic type of prostitutes:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Really?

out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: God I hope not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: ʔYeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: That'll ruin everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Yeah: my social life is going downhill.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Well my social life is n:aturally going downhill because everyone I know is getting old.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: which really sucks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Sh:it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Football.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I hate football.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Yeah: same here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Everyone's getting ol:d no one wants to drink anymo:re everyone's got girlfriends that they care about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I know it's like I don't even hear from Gregg anymore what's up with that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I don't know he ʔuh Kathy's gonna be go:ne for two weeks so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: So all of a sudden he- it's like he's gonna spring back into our lives hoping?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Probably.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I don't think so.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PATR: Well ever since he heard that I was having problems with my band you know he's been calling me a lot more: we've been hanging out and stuff.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I just really
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: ʔuh That's what pisses me off.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Cause like ʔuh the same thing is going on with uh with Marlisse.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: You know it's it was like all of a sudden well here we did all this stuff and for about a month now she's had a boyfriend?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: And I call her she's never home.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: It's like uh I got a hold of her: yesterday actually I mean I even tried to call her on New Y
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: on Christmas.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: And she wasn't there a:nd now it's like I'm like uh: where the hell are you?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: You know and I haven't seen you in a while.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CORI: like X I'm sorry and then she's going out of tow:n Florida for: till like school starts now on the third.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: It all sucks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I remember this story.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: It all sucks because it's one thing like for me and you to hang out and stuff like that at Victor's an:d whatever but we're at two to- totally different social levels.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I mean it's easier for women to walk into a bar not know anyone and then come out knowing everybody.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: It's hard for a guy to because then he comes off like a big huge pervert.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So I'd have to be chasing you around and cramping your style it's just cool that all the girls go out and all guys go out and if you're two social: whatever at the same bouncing around know everybody level it's cool.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know cause I don't wanna sit here and drag you down and stuff and junk.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Cool.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: You remember this story?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: What is it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: This
in,TRUE,FALSE,CORI: ʔThis guy this is a true story uh he took a
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: It's
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Well it took em like tw
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: over twenty years to catch this guy.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: He went and shot his entire f:amily.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: And then disappeared.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Well?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: So why did he shoot his family.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Cause he was afraid that their morality was going downhill.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Well yeah:?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: So he shot his mother his kids and his wife.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Oh and his daughter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: oh then the milkman comes.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I can kick em I can kick em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I
in,FALSE,TRUE,PATR: I don't think it's all sick and twisted.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CORI: You know the last time I s- seen gr- it was like last night I was f- ʔuh watching
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: You know it was like I was at Victor's and all of a sudden I saw Showgirls?

in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Don't have her look at you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: That was the last time I did anything with Gregg though.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: That was when.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Oh and you know what also hap- is like they wound up not their bod
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: ʔuh Since he like cancelled all this stuff and like he pulled
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: He had said it's like ʔuh you know I'm pulling my kids out of school I'm taking em out out for a vacation and shit?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: And all this and that so no one suspected that the family was dead.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: For how long.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: A month or two months:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Wow.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: So they were like laying there in the house and all of a sudden it's like started stinking and someone walked in the house and found all their decomposed bodies?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: And he by this time he had disappeared.

out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: S:o.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: After twenty years they could let the guy go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You % laugh know % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: He killed his whole fucking family though.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Yeah that's twenty years ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: He didn't do it since.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: At least they're now moral.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: Ts: % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Wha:t % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: I can't believe your rationale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: You know I was just joking.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: I would never like you know s:eriously think about walking up th- behind someone with a gun.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: And like p:ulling the trigger and watching your brains splatter all over the nice white
in,FALSE,TRUE,PATR: I mean I mean all over the wall.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CORI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: No I'm just joking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PATR: Just wanted to scare you a little bit.
