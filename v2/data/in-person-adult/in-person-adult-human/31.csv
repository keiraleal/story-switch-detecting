in,TRUE,FALSE,BETH: She was saying that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: that that we were talking about um different students being held back for different reasons and that about children being put oh I was telling her about that one of your girls read at such a low level that really should have been and they said well why didn't they put her in remedial and I said well I don't know but.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: She was in remedial.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Well I said for one thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,BETH: they can't put em in remedial without the parents' consent.

in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: That's two different things.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: That was the first thing I said.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: And then she was saying well she just didn't do Greg any good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: You know and I just about I didn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: I didn't b- but I you know I told Bill later I said Greg learned more from Missus Jackson than he ever learned from Missus Meyer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Oh well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Probably.
in,FALSE,TRUE,BETH: Becau:se he tried harder for her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: And he ⌈ really

out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: ʔThat was mine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JAMI: Okay he made the kebabs a little bit bigger than I
in,FALSE,FALSE,JAMI: regular and I made the salad a little bigger so we put em on separate plates.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Oh wow: % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,BETH: And I'm gonna get full then hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: What a deal.
in,TRUE,TRUE,ROSE: I had the croissant.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Thank you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Thanks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: And
out,FALSE,FALSE,JAMI: Is everything alright now.

in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Missus Jackson is still there when Doug gets to second grade she's not gonna get her hands on him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Oh % laugh brother % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: and I said Greg Doug would probably do wonderful in her class.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Greg did w- r
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: finally did well.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Well and for one thing it bothered me because Anna takes ahold of something like that and doesn't let go.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: And Sharon doesn't even think about what she's saying.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: She just starts y- nya and I was just.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ROSE: You should tell Sharon that principals do not take kindly to parents telling em what room they want their kids in.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,BETH: I thought b:oy:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: They oughta put Doug in there just to show her.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Mm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Sh- probably just as well I'm not havi:ng Doug.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Well she just
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: I mean Greg.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: There's just the whole attitude.

in,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: In kindergarten this year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Hm.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: You know?
in,TRUE,FALSE,BETH: I said probably that one day the
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: The teacher and you both just had a bad day and it came off on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: Probably just as well I wasn't there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: Oh: I was I told Bill I had several things I wanted to say and I probably would've if Anna wouldn't ve been there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,BETH: But I watch myself a lot closer around her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: M-.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ROSE: This is good clam chowder but it's not as good as Uncle Don made.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: He made some?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Oh after they had gone clamming?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: One of those
in,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: You know I don't think Sharon would've said it if you'd ve been around.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: She better not.

out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: it wa- didn't ⌉
in,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: if % laugh it % laugh doesn't taste like clam.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ROSE: Because evidently fresh clams don't haven't developed a real strong flavor yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: ʔHunh- unh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: How do they get their flavor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Being canned or something?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ROSE: I would think so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BETH: And refrigerated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SHER: Mm.
