out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: The
in,TRUE,FALSE,REBE: The way that your testimony is coming in I don't know if I explained this to you on the phone.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: m.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: is when a person is charged with multiple crimes a:nd u:m there are other incidences where he: acted in the same way?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: When we have to prove in this case we have to prove specific intent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: to: expose himself to a person for sexual arousal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m when we have to prove something like specific intent um or we have to prove identity.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Because he's disputing identity in a coup
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: in at least one of the cases.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m then w:e are allowed to bring in prior similar conduct.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m where he acted in a an identical way or where the victims were in a similar situation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Things like that That's why we're able to have you come in and testify.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay U:m the cases that we have already are um one happened back in October of nineteen ninety.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and it happened on BART and it's almost a carbon copy of your case.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Well I've made two one a year from almost a year from the uh police report.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: I saw that in your report.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: I haven't seen the other report.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah I made that one through: matter of fact it was just over the phone and they never called me back or anything and a year later it happened again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: a:nd then that's when they made the report and said they were gonna do something about it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICK: S:o it hap⌈pened around
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So you can testify to two of em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuh ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: That's why I had you come up because:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: u:m that's great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Um I mean not for you % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: for us.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALL: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REBE: U:m i
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: in our first case Amelia Gonzalez um that uh that happened back in ninety.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And she was seated aʔ- in the rear of the train.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: which you were.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: u:m nobody else was around and he: sort of walked up and down the train.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Down the aisle Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: checked everything out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and then sat down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: put the newspaper on his lap.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: masturbated and then lifted the paper up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: for her to see.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And she saw it in the the re⌈flection.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌊ n- n
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Oh the mirror ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: cause she was ⌉ looking ⌈ out the window.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: That's how I did it too.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: saying I don't want ⌉ to see this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Cause I didn't want to see him so I looked this way and you can see it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Cause it turns into the mirror effect.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And he was just sort of staring at her and lifting up the paper.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m so anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Exactly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: it c
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: it's a carbon copy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REBE: a:nd um in that case he's ʔuhʔuh he sits through all the testimony and he just sort of shakes his head and makes these big gasps like you know we're creating this whole thing against him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REBE: and then with June.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: um the woman that just walked ou:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: u:m she was riding on BART and he came and sat near her she moved he moved to get closer to her she moved again and he moved directly opposite her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and then started masturbating.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: well see what it is it seems like he wants someone more scary: yʔʔ- I don't kno:w cause he would walk up and down the aisles there was women on the other side too but they'd look like you know you wouldn't mess with em but if you're sitting there you know trying to mind your own business or:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: look like you can intimidate someone you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I i
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: that's what it look like.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: I think that's I think he he finds somebody that's isolated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: a:nd he: goes for a certain age group I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REBE: U:m a:nd you know like ʔuhʔuh for some reason I think he likes students or people who look like students:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So anyway okay u:m did you: as far as your um mileage goes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: What would did
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Oh how much was it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: Hundred and thirty: s- I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And we got the um that ticket for our X?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Parking?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: They moved the ga:te or something?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: The how to % laugh get in the parking % laugh lot % laugh cause it used to be on X.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Oh yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Because they built this building.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌈ See.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: That's where the yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICK: we had to ⌉ get back all the way on the ⌈ freeway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Oh: no:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: and I was like oh ⌉ God there was a door here before a entrance you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I couldn't find it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICK: but uh % laugh we found it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Um oh okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Do you know how much it's gonna be?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Oh no not yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m do you guys have the cash to pay for it right now?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: When you- to get out?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah I think so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REBE: Then what I'll do is when
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: you can
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: I'll call you and find out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: What I have to do is submit all of this to our accounting department.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and they give you the they'll mail you the reimbursement.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So you guys hang on to ⌈ that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: s⌉o you can get out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And then I imagine it will be about five dollars or so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m so.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: a hundred and thirty: about a hundred and thirty five you think?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: M hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REBE: So round trip it'll be like two seventy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: two si
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: That's from Salinas?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Do you go by Rickie Reeding- R- Reeding Rollins or do you just go by Rickie Rollins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Uh R
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: u:m well my name is Regina I just go by Rickie:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: uh I don't know if you have to put my Regina in there:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah probab-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: um i
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Regina Rollins is fine it doesn't matter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Whatever is easier for you guys.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: You guys newly married?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Well just a year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: A yea:r two days ago.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Oh great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Soon you'll be in my condition.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: which is pregnant.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌈ Aw really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: A:w % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Con⌉gratulations.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Thanks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REBE: Let's just go through um Iʔ- I have your statement but I just want to have you tell me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: what happened.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: do you remember the date?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: N:o.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Because I'll be saying to you do you reca:ll o:n August twelfth nineteen ninety two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay and it was about one o'clock?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So first of all where did you get on BART.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: A:t Oakland.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And where were you going.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: U:m to the doctor's in San Francisco.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: San Francisco.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: A:nd u:m when you got on BART I'll ask you to: describe where you sat on the train.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and let me show you um what I have This is a diagram of the interior of BART.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay looking at that these are the b:acks of the seats.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So facing that way okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m can you
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: U:m that's the train.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: uʔ That seat right there I always sit going backwards.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I have:
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay so the train was traveling that way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So u:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And it's hard to describe how so: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I was sitting backwards in the back seat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: The very end seat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: A:nd when he came in when where was he when you first saw him come in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuh He got on the trai:n o:n like I think Twelfth Street or something?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: in Oakland?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And like in a let me see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He got on another car.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: But you can
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I I seen him because I seen him a year ago.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: So I seen him when the you know how the trai:n goe:s and you can see everybody out the window well he got in another: door.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And he came through here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So he came through he⌈re.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: when he ⌉ came through here did he look at you at all?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Initially?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: What did he do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Just loo:ked: he had a
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Did he stop walking?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: n: just kinda loo:ked and then loo:ked and then walked.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And then he kept walking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: When he looked at you the first time was he sort of looking you up and down or did he just look at your seat what
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Just like you know look.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuh uʔh I guess: X
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: At you?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: At me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Di
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah and look at my seat cause I always sit all the way to the window.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: So I thought he was gonna sit down.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Actually.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And then he continued on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and where did he go.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He went all the way to the you know into the trai:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: All the way up here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And the:n uh he went through the door and then he ca:me back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He went through th⌈ere.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: He went through these doors?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: into it unhunh ⌉ into another car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Oh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And then he came back again and then I guess that was like another stop and more people were getting off and the:n that's when he came and s:at b:y me sat in this seat right here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: But there was someone sitting there too:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: there was a lady.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: You're kidding.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Unhunh there was a lady sitting there but she got up and she went to another seat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Ah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: She she just went to a different seat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know like but he was m:aking ʔuh: I don't know how you describe it you know how you can be like a nuisance to someone?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: O:r you may sme:ll or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: you know like that you ⌈ know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: or ⌉ mo:ving arou:nd you know like as he wanted her to move.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And she got up and moved.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: S- she okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m and so when she moved was there anybody seated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: X:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: in this area.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I think maybe like you know how these chairs are?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Maybe right he:re and you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: but you couldn't they couldn't see: nothing or: anybody.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay but nobody right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: No: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: in these area⌈s.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I don't believe so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So then wh:at did he do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: U:m did the newspaper ʔuh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: you know: looking at it you know making loud noises I guess so I think like that or whatever the:n he just kept doing that to the newspaper like that and the:n he went i:n and then he just you can just see him going like this you know how you have to unzip your pa:nts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: or something like tha:t and I'm looking through the w:indow.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: and then he's still making n:oises with the paper and then um I kinda looked and then I didn't and I kept making like s: uh: you know like you know like I know what you're
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: He was making noises like that?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: No: he was making those: you know the rattling paper.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: but I was making noises like you know like I wanted him to know I know what you're doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know I remembered him for a year
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: from a year ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And so then I just kept you know I just turned you know away from him and I looked in the window and he just kept hitting the paper.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: like that you kno:w?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: But you know what he was doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He kept hitting the paper and um uh: let me see then one time I jus:t you know kinda looked over: and then you can see it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know: you can see it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Had he l:ifted up the paper in any way or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah just like you know I'm trying to see how a paper goes likes thi-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Like this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔOkay ʔuhʔuhʔuh like he has the paper like like thi:s just like you know moves it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Like that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know ⌈ like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Oh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You ⌉ know: and you can see it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Was he looking at you at all during that time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌊ Ye:s.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: The ⌋ who:le enti:re ti:me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I mean not looking at first he would go like this even with the paper.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And look at me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know trying to get my attention.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Like he: wanted me to look at him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: And then the whole time under here he'd just look.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: I mean ʔuhʔuh he looked so hard that it was like burning you know what I mean?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: It
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Tell the jury that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: That's
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: I mean that's great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He just alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m Because that's what he does.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And that's his way of drawing your attention to ⌈ him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: bec⌉ause if somebody's doing that to you there's no way you're gonna you know just totally ignore them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: cause you're always going to wanna keep them in your peripheral vision.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: at least.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: to make sure wh:ere they are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Cause I was you know I didn't know what he was gonna do % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: or anything so:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: so: um- part of our burden is to prove that he's deliberately doing th- that he has the specific intent to draw your attention to him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So let them know that he was doing that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So then and then he sort of pulled the paper aside and he's still staring at you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Unhunh still sta:ring and just you know and the:n but when uh uh: like you come to a stop see that's all through the tunnel.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know that's a long like about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: five minute ride or something?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: A couple of minutes ride and we got t:o like Embarcadero he would just you know go like this you know before anyone got on and wait and then just do the same thing until I had to get off at my stop.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Tell the jury about that too because tha:t indicates that he knew what he was doing was wro:ng.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Oh okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and if there was a chance that any man might walk by.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌊ yʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: You know I had another case or I have a pr- report from another case where u:m he wa
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: he was crouched down and doing it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: and then when a man would walk by he'd sit up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: And you know do nothing and then once the man was through the doors then he'd go back X X doing it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yea:h.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m okay so then you got off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: at your stop.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m and how were you feeling.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: We:ll it was like s:- I don't know sorry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ARNO: You doing alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: just I don't know like disgusted you know wh- why I really wanted to report it this time because it was like summertime?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: and the kids?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know the kids and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: that's what I was scared of because I know how uh I was you know a victim of you know abuse like that or ʔuh I just you know I just That's what I was think- the very first time I reported it was just like this dirty old ma:n just that tha⌈:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ⌉ And this time it was during the summer and there was lots: of ki:ds and um I just felt like you know upset.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICK: and I jus:t you know I just felt upset.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: You know n
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Tell the jury that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Um it's it's really important that they understand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: the feelings that go through you when somebody does something like that to you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: ʔuhʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: cau⌈se.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: ⌉ my one concern about this case i:s u:m that some people may have the attitude of.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: well he never touched you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: he didn't make any verbal threats to you it's no big deal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: A:nd especially I have some young single men on my jury panel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: A:nd ʔuh Iʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: my worry is that they don't relate to what a woman feels when something like that is happening.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: because their experience would be totally different.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: if a man exposes himself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: which a man would never do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Because.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: number one they pick out I think more vulnerable peo⌈ple.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: ⌉ But if u:m a ma:n were to be exposed to they would laugh or you know be disgusted.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: or be mad but they wouldn't necessarily feel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JUNE: .

out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: U:m and then uh so then when you got off you called the poli⌈ce.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Right ⌉?
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICK: I went upstairs to the BART and told them and I tried to tell them what train it was an:d I just I was still kind of like shocked so I ʔI was like well I have to go cause I have to make an appointment but I di:d tell someone I said I'll be back to make a report or whatever I had to do and then there was a different person down there and when I called the BART police they said oh no one's even said anything to us you know and uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: That was that and then I think uh: couple of days after one of the uh detectives called me and then I made a report.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICK: He wanted to see if I can ID him first and then we just made a report and he said he'll submit it and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: Okay.

in,FALSE,FALSE,REBE: for the most part he'll be polite and gentle.
