out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I tell you man that factory's the pits ma⌈n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: What's new.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: last night ⌉ I got into a hassle with James Boyd.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I'm in the cafeteria.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: and I took a: break that was just a little bit too long man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ⌈ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: ⌊.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I can imagine ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: ha⌋:lf hou:r brea:k.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You stretched a fifteen minute break into a half hour break.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: to a half hour.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And then he comes into the cafeteria.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And I thought he was coming in to chase everybody away.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: He was after you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But he's coming after me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And he calls me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And I'm walking % laugh out the door.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right as he's walking in the other one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Unhu:nh?
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And he goes Fred I wanna talk to you come here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And % laugh I go oh: man what is this about.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And on my production card.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Let's see.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: The day before yesterday.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I did ice cream.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right Balian?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And you gotta pack those in cases.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: so like I didn't put that down on my production card.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: How many cases you packed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I don't know man.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I packed two pallets.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know I don't know how many cases that is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: but you know that that shit was heavy man.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And like and like I put down on the card you know no cases.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Because it was lost time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know you know we.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: we stripped the sides and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ⌊ Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: and l⌈ike.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Y- y- you were teaming up with somebody.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: there were no cases ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: or working alone.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: ʔuh: I w
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: uh: ʔuh Gutierrez was doing the same job.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But we weren't working together.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Oh you're working alone.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: yeah and so he comes and says well he goes I don't know if you've if you've packed this or not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: On your production card all it says you know is that you did three thousand sheets but you did
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Two loads.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But you didn't pack it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So I go yeah I go look man there they are.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You could see there's my name ʔuh: stamped right on there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I just didn't put it down.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh well I gotta figure it out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And he goes and what are you doing in the cafeteria so late.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I'm just going aw man this is the pits man.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: This is at the bottom of the
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: That's the last thing you wanted to hear.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: ʔuh This fucking mayate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know getting on my case.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: Well that's nothing new.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: It's nothing ⌈ new.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: It's always been like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: it's
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: It's p⌉ar for the course man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah definitely.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: Ts- why I: can't take that that type of living anymore even is this uh career doesn't work out for me I'll find something that will.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Something else.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Well you're gonna do real estate maybe right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Definitely I'm
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I got my books and everything I'll be studying and uh but in a sense I need uh some type of steady income.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But but uh: you s
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Th- the competition man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I mean is it real tough?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Like on the lot?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah it is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: There's def
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And there's guys that've been doing that four or five years and.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And they're real good at it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: that are real good at it an:d they: know how to talk to the people and they know that when somebody's coming in if they're buying or not.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh they could tell right away.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah but that all comes with time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You know ⌈ and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: and they're ⌉ pretty helpful with me and uh you know it'll all come in time.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right I- I figure the more cards I get out the more people I talk to n- the more cars I'm gonna sell.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Just all comes with time.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: Once I get my experience I'll be up there too in the top four salesman.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: Your parents don't know yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: N:o.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: They'll know when they come back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: and I think my dad told me yesterday they're coming back the fifteenth?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: or sixteenth?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: def⌋inite
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I think s
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ʔuh: It's gonna be the fifteenth which would be on a Saturday I think.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And I'll be working till nine o'clock.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So they'll they'll be pretty: happy for me more or less because uh they didn't want me to work in the factory much longer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah I know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: My mom doesn't know what to do to get me out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But they didn't take a trip through: Brazil and Argentina?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I don't know I don't know they- they they didn't
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They spent the whole time in: Guayaquil?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah I think so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: They tol
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: My dad told me he was gonna go to uh: Argentina and Peru and Colombia but he only wrote one letter and and they were in uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: No one's called em ʔy- I mean no one's talked to them?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: He sent postcards to everybody and a letter but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: Other than that he hasn't called or told us what's up and he'll be in here no time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Is he staying over at Miguel Juarez's?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah?
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: And uh: the other architect.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Is his nephew or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Pe
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Pedro Cruz.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Pedro Cruz.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah he's a architect or.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I never met him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I know Miguel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ⌈ That's his.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I've been to his house a number of time-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: his nephew.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: Th- one of ⌉ his brother's sons or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Unhunh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: But uh: they'll come back they'll be happy to see me here tha:t I got a new career going and uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They weren't all heartbroken about you know Jeanie and that?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Well they have no idea what's happening right now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They must have been
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They have no idea xxx.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: When they left we were on shaky grounds but ʔuh: you know they thought it might be able to work out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So when they come in they'll be pretty shocked.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And and hurt.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: But uh like I say things will work out f- for the best.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: What about her folks.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They're not sorry at all huh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: No: uh in fact I've seen em I
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I w- I went to church with em for the last three Sundays.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Really?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: With Jeanie.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Wow:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: She thought it might you know help our relationship as friends and uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: She still considers you man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: She does because I mean we went to church together for the last three Sundays.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: and then then we went to the movies after and her: her folks were at church and you know ʔn:- afterwards her mom w- had a injury on her leg or something she wasn't at church last Sunday we went to the to their house.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: ʔuh And uh I went over there and her brother was there her nephews and nieces her sister our godson And uh: you know it was just like everybody was real friendly and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I don't know if the parents a:re awa:re that we did you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Break up?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: separate but ʔit possibly was for the better cause they they didn't feel comfortable with us living together anyhow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: right that's not looked on too good hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: No.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So ʔw- what they what they probably think is you know that we still have a_lot_of: love for each other That m:oving out was the best thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But sh
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: until we bo:th are ready for marriage and if she s:till loves me a:nd I still love her: and we wanna get married there's still the chance of us getting back together and getting married this time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So I mean it
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: ʔI: think things are working out pretty good.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: She called me the other day and uh you know she calls me and talks to me and I call her and ask her how her day was and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: What what does uh your sisters say.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: N- they tell me to stay away from her don't even call or anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah:?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Wait till she calls you and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: But ʔuh you know that's not right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's hard man.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I mean if she accepts me calling her and she doesn't tell me don't call me or.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They're telling you that why.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: To like uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Cause they feel that she's gonna get too strong by me you know uh kissing her ass.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: or something or or or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Exactly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: crawling back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I see.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: and begging her ʔuh you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: ⌈.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: for me to come back or.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: She gonna get ⌉ the upper hand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Which which you know ʔuh: she probably already does.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: But um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I'm not gonna just wait for her to call me because it's not right I have feelings for her I wanna know you know how she's d⌈oing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: doing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I'm gonna ⌉ communicate with her.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: That's all there is to it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: It's not like I w
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I'm asking her you know let me move back in or you know: I'm sorry I
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You just
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I just wanna remain friends with her and find out how she's doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So they they tell
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: I don't tell em I call or nothing.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: You know and uh And I sent her flowers last week I sent her flowers to work.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah: % laugh?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: The day before I moved out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Just to tell her I was so:rry about everything that had happened and that uh you know I hope we could remain friends and that God brings us back together if it was meant to be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And she was real happy about this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: She said that really meant a lot to me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You know That you did send me flowers and uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And then
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Then the and what you wrote.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Cause she knew it came from my heart no matter what I'd put her through and everything she knows deep down inside I really did love her but I had a problem or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You had to get something out of your system.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: But I don't even know what it is in fact.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: I might have to go to therapy or something to fi:nd out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Because there's no
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: There's no way I I shoul⌈d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: you know ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You should be like this?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Exactly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I mean an
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: People say you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: y:ou act out of uh it's okay most men do look at other women and uh you know things go through their mind and everything but that I'm impulsive.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I'd act on my impulse.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Like I'd see something I'd want it and I'd go after her where I w- I had a beautiful woman I shouldn't have thought like that at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: This what a lady told me that that was a therapist.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: She said she was gonna get me somebody to go talk to and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: She said it po
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Ma
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: possibily was I was uh not satisfied with myself.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: I wasn't happy with myself for some reason a:nd that I just acted out of impulse.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So: I don't know.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: ʔi:- it is a problem because I ʔuh: I I did have a nice old lady and um Kind of miss her and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: It's lonely coming home after putting in t- twelve hours on the lot.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: And working all day and you know working all evening and then you don't have any:body to come home and share it with.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Y- are y
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Are you working twelve hours?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You're gonna be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You're gonna be doing that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Nine to nine?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Definitely.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Nine to nine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Well I mean- If I want.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: That's a
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: That's up to me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: Basically you know they're gonna give us a shift.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Either nine in the morning to three in the afternoon or: or th- two in the afternoon to nine in the evening.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: See.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So if I wanted to come in before two if I was on the the evening shift I would come in at nine and work nine to nine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: If I was on the evening shift from two to nine I could come in and work from nine to nine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So um when you went last week and you applied right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Mhm?
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: they they hired you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right on the spot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right on the spot.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: He gave me interview he talked to me told me w:hy I w:anted to get into sales and if if I felt I could sell if I had any experience and everything and.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You told him about all the cars that you had owned and sold.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah I told him that I had done.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: C- y- sh- you- sh
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: so- sold cars all through my early years but it was private party.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: f- uh- you've had- you
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You've had about like thirty ⌈ cars.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: At least.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: hunh ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: At least.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: At least thirty cars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So I have some type of experience selling dealing with people.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know about cars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: handling the money and uh the only thing it is ʔth- ʔI: have to work on is doing the paperwork.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Is uh filling out a contract and uh: basically paperwork which is f- very simple.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: That you know once it comes along with experience and the more people I work with the easier it will it'll be that's the: most important thing and and selling them the car talking to somebody in to buying a car that doesn't wanna buy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Tha- that's there to look.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: But yet wouldn't mind owning a new car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: A:nd you've gotta talk em into it you gotta sell it to em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You know?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You gotta em in your office and you gotta sell that car to em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You can't let em leave without that sale.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Otherwise they're gonna go elsewhere.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: If they believe you and you can sell em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You need this car.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: you gonna make a_lot_of money.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: you want ⌈ this car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Definetely.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: take ⌉ it with you % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Wh:at can I do for you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: in order for you to buy this car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I mean if is the price too much?
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I could work on the price.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Let me go talk to my manager.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Maybe I could drop it five hundred dollars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Maybe we have a hundred rebate that you could use towards the down payment.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: W:- maybe it's it's three point nine financing that'll save you money in the long run uh if you finance fifteen or sixteen thousand dollars.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: you know it's just it's uh it's ʔuh like a game.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So homes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Uh they they put you through training all these days?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Is that it?
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah five days I watched uh videotapes dealing with this guy that that ʔuh: that sold cars and made a hundred thous
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: His goal was to make a hundred thousand dollars every year selling cars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: And he accomplished his goal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Every year he sold a hundred thousand dollars and he retired.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh my god.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: at five after c:ertain amount of years selling and uh he just got into ʔuh making uh audio cassettes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: In sales.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: To motivati
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Motivation s- uh tapes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh I see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: and uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: A system.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: To: sell.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Books seminar:s um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: video tapes.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Hundred thousand a year.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: That guy must've hustled.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah well it's possible.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RICH: You figure you could sell at least twenty cars a month every month for twelve months you know you're gonna be up there in f- ʔuh seventy eighty thousand dollar bracket.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Twenty cars in a month.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's almost a car a day.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Which isn't difficult.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: X
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: If you're on the lot for a damn twelve hours ʔuh: one car isn't all that much if you have the clients coming in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: That's the only thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: If you have the traffic.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: we're on a busy street Firestone Boulevard.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Firestone where by the six o five?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: R- exactly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right before the six o five.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right by

in,FALSE,TRUE,RICH: A mi⌉le going uh east.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: You know I have been wanting to go visit you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But I'm afraid you're gonna sell me a car bro.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah well that's the last thing you need to do is get in: any more debt than you already are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I'm hip man I gotta get outa my debts.

out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Take a shower.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Why not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Because like.

out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I don't know if they're playing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: I don't know

out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Um w- ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Now this warmup regulator is that uh ʔuh: different than a cold start valve?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RICH: Okay cause I did have one put in I think uh: about three months ago or something?
