out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well let's kind of figure out a cla:ssic u:m ʔuh: diet uh quota ʔuh ʔuh for % laugh you % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And let me get a piece of paper so that we can write that down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: The way we do: this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: is first of all we make a a guesstimate of how many calories typically that you would need.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: D- we- we didn't do this last time did we.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: m:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Alright.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah I think we were gonna wait until we cause you were gonna change some things maybe after you saw Doris.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So first of all we make a good guesstimate.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Of how many calories you need.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that's always a tough one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: m:⌉ost women unless you work out a l:o:t.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You probably aren't burning much more than like eighteen hundred to maybe: two thousand calories.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So what we can do um I would say I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Just because uh you're at a good weight you're about five fi:ve u:m ʔI think that would be a prudent place to to start out from.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I know I won't uh cause you to gain weight and you probably won't lose any either.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ But uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌋ Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So we're gonna take eighteen hundred calories:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Uh h
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: How um how many calories do you think I'm eating now or can you even tell: that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: from looking?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I could do a calorie count um on that but I'd actually need more amounts:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Although you wouldn't be able to tell because there's no ʔuh I don't write down like the fa:ts and things like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well if if you gave me real specific amounts.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: Like I had you know one quarter cup of soy milk half a cup of cereal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: th⌈en I could
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Oh okay
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: I could cou:nt your cal⌉ories.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌋.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: and and figure that out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And run it through the computer.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And get a printout.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hm:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: O:f your nutrient ratio: and everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Wow.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: For the day.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: In fact if you wanna do that I'd be glad to run it for you But you'd have to take one day.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm⌈:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ And re:ally:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: And write everything down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: be:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: like ⌋ precise.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: So eighteen hundred calories ti:mes point four that's gonna be f:orty calories or excuse me.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: Um forty % laugh percent of your calories coming from carbo hydrate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that's Doris's standard protocol really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay times point four gives us seven hundred and twenty carbo:hydrate calories.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Then we divide that by four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Calories per gram.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You've
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I know you've seen this before.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Which gives us a quota of a hundred and eighty gra:ms of carbohydrate per day.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Actually I should've done that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Then we have to distribute it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Wow:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's % laugh lo:w.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's not ⌉ that much⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ It is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Then we have to ⌋ distribute that into a an ideal ratio.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Now you always do have breakfast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Unless you're running a bit on the higher side.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Really high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And you always have some kinda lunch pretty much and you always have some kind of dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Well yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Basical⌈ly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Now the morning ⌉ snack the snacks are hit and miss.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That's where we maybe would h- have to to look at things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A little bit more closely.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But u:sually lunch and dinner are your main: meals.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And we would give you about a thirty percent quota at both lunch and dinner which is about fifty fou:r grams at each of those places.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Would be sort of your ballpark quota.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And ʔuh it's not outlandish.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Like here you were four well a little bit higher.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Here well you were about uh forty ni:ne s:ixty:-four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So four fifty that was four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So it's a little bit higher.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Is what you're used to doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A:nd u:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah ʔuh I remember.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Like a lo:ng long time ago.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Let's see uh it was I guess f:orty maybe forty five seventy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Or some⌈thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: O:kay:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's how they had it di⌉vided ⌈ up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I think ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Although that's m- mo:re.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Let's see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: T_sounds pretty high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's: what.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: A total of a hundred and
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It might've been based either on a higher calorie level.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: o:r a higher percent of your calories coming from carbos.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Like if this were fifty percent?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Which is probably more realistic for how you eat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Being a vegetarian you eat more
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔuh ʔAnd we can change it up.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But we'll use this as a ba:se.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then we wanna compare it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: to what you typically do: and the thing is if you started % laugh doing this right now you'd have low blood sugars.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Ri:ght.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause you've already adjusted your insulin.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: to another level.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But I think what you could learn from this is tha:t u:m at least if you sort of cho:se a s:tandard place for a while?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Until you got things a little more stabilized it might be easier to do your insulin.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then um once you: y- are a little more comfortable with that the:n you can start doing this f:lux with:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: R:ight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: adding the unit for another ten grams.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Say if you usually have four and you find you know ex units of insulin works for tha:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: well ʔuh then you can- jockey it from there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Now at breakfast we often keep that down around twe:lve becau:se.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Twe:lve?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Wow:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh percent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: point one two ti:mes ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I thought you ⌋ meant gra:ms.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I was gonna say h- where do you find foo:d that's that low.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ Well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: some people actually ⌉ end up having to do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That's only about two grams.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Zero: or something?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Because of that dawn phenomenon.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So that's not much at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: The:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah: like even an English muffin is too much.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Even oatmeal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It's it's ʔuh really difficult.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: you can either have either or sort of a thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Let's see sixty two: okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So that gives us a eight to: distribute throughout the rest of the day:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A:nd um making a decision of how to do that really involves: your insulins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Now in the morning you've got a good amount.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Of regular insulin that you take?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So I would wanna put a little bit higher percentage for your snack there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I would say maybe even ten percent here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: See I ha:te that sna:ck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh Having to eat snacks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔuh ʔOh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I just don't have ti:me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: The only trouble with that is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh ʔuh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: at breakfast you just won't have your insulins there for you to eat the big carbo breakfast ⌈ typically.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ Unless you run hi:gh after breakfast.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then it comes down when the insulins finally do get working.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But then you're running high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that's you know that's the only way to protect yourself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: is yeah you eat a bunch of carbo you take a bunch of insulin you run high for an hour and a half.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: and then all of a sudden it comes s:kyrocketing ⌈ down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ When all the insulins get on board.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So: um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Righ:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh: point one okay that's just gonna be eighteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I wonder how
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: roughly there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh How does Doris do that though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Because she like I don't think she eats lu:nch or anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: she just like has this really minimal dose of NPH I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ You'd have to ask her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ That's what uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I do:n't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That's what I suspe:ct.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I don't know the trade secrets there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um ⌉ bu:t uh: h- ʔuh: you know I think pro:bably: u:m keeping the carbo:s a little on the lower side enable
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Of course then you'd need less insulin which makes life easier.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It does make it easier if you do eat less carbo.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause you don't have to take these big amounts and then wonder what they're gonna do and ⌈ when.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ U:m this actually sometimes makes it more complicated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Now mid afternoo:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: you are taking a touch of regular at lu:nch but you: do:n't really: eat much of a snack.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Usually.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: After lunch.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause you have a late lunch might have some Cheetos there I see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔOh that was just cause I was like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: couldn't eat ⌈ dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ Cashews.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I had to go to something like right at at six o'clo:ck or seven o'clock ⌈ or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So that really may be o:ne.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: whe:re it's sort of debatable.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You know maybe at the most you'd have five percent there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m and I'm just sort of guessing as a place to sta:rt ʔuh why'd I do that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I knew what it was?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that's just hardly anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That's a f
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Some a few nuts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that's about it or ʔuh u:m then later on you do sometimes eat after dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause you're kind of a night owl a:nd u:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: let's see this'll go two plus uh so we're looking at about roughly thirteen fifteen percent there so okay so approximately well s- essentially like breakfast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So those would just be places to start from.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But I think um what's even more important.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: O:kay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: i:s you've gotta tailor it to what your insulin is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And use these as a jumping off place.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You know if you say well this is ridiculous I always have a seventy carbo dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: well so what.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You know ʔuh there's nothing wrong with that it just means you: slightly adjust that insulin.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Same thing if you: do:n't like snacks what are you gonna do: to: co:mpens⌈ate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: for the ⌉ fact that there's there's a lotta insulin there maybe.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A:nd um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔuh how are you gonna get around that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um but that's the sole purpose of snacks is to really prevent lows from happening and to counteract um the insulin time actions.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔM
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌈ Oh
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Maybe we should compare
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Go ahead.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Oh I just had one question s:o for example.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Unhunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: say I didn't eat lunch?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Then what would happen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Like then I could not take the insulin there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: And then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: But the:n I ⌈ don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: you probably would need to eat a little something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I wonder.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I would get high: then maybe hunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: becau:se of your NPH ⌈ peaking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: although ⌉ you don't ta:ke a lo:t of NPH.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: In the morning yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It may be debatable if you really % laugh need to have something later in the af- uh: or b- to get you into dinner okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hmm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You know you might have to eat sort of an afternoon snack if you don't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um o:r yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Take look at look at the NPH that you're taking a:nd y- ʔuh Doris could help you with that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Did she give you a scale for a w- no lunch lunch scale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: A w- whi:le ago but um it changed after that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: See this was the original thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That I had.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: She said but
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Okay this was hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: This was a while ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: See three four four.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: So um: like for example she had these two: things so if I wa:s gonna eat like say I I decided ok- in the morning.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I was gonna eat lunch?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Then I would take fou:r units of NPH and then supplement it with the regular but if I knew: like say in the morning?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: That I wasn't gonna eat lunch?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: she said take ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: But this doesn't make any sense.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: To me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Take six NPH cause I would be low: with thi:s then definitely.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ Yeahʔ:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: In in the afternoon.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah ʔuh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I think this was kinda guessing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: too.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh Cause it was before.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh I had really
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Definitely: um: ʔuh you know ch:eck with her: on your insulins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause ʔuh you know she: is the only one that can really clarify them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m ʔuh you know just it's tough.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: To to do the jockeying of of the food and the insulin.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It really um ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It it just it makes it really um a a challenge there to.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Well this is where I got the idea that she d- ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Probably doesn't eat lunch.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Well ʔuh I don't know how she would have ti:me anyway.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Every time you see her it's like you know five minutes here five minutes there but um then also just like um I don't know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: She sort of like knew what I mea:nt when I was ⌈ saying.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Unhunh ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: oh it's such a ⌉ pain to have to stop and eat lunch.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: And so um that's where I got that idea.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: But.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well it's ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Let's see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And so four of N six of N and then zero regular there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That's where just monitoring monitoring monitoring.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔYeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Righ:t.

out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I feel ⌉ like uh we're ʔuh still in a pickle in that um it's just every day is so different⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: a:nd ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: you know you're you're adjusting your insulins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Ri:ght.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: uh per your uh protocols that you have there and the carbos: are varying arou:nd that um but ʔuh: you know I think it's important we ʔuh: make some kind of a: a goal to ʔuh prevent these low:s from happening.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: a:nd uh try and prevent the ones that are creeping up a little bit too high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And you know wh:at do you: th:ink u:m that uh you could do to h- clarify this a little bit more and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: make it a little easier.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Well I guess maybe if I try thi:s.

out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Maybe it's ea:sier if I have like some kind of set thing cause then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Something ⌈ to shoot for.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Kinda ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh: Cause otherwise I'll just do whatever I feel like doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Obviously.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: X Well ʔuh you you could give this a try: as far as the levels but what I would do is is u:se what you're currently doing as sort of a backup guide.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Because obviously if you're having and and this has cha:nged.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A lot.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh over the past few days.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But um well one day you have eight at breakfast.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: The next day you have none.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh Yeah but that's like if it:'s hi:gh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Forty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: And it also like sometimes I just write em in different columns.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Cause.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Cause uh depending on what time it was.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But if you're having only you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Around and what you could do is sort of rou:nd these.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A little bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Like shoot for say five ⌈ or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ just say every morning you're gonna have a thirty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: like a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Per⌈iod.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ That's um ʔuh it it would work.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then you just start learning from that⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You kn⌉ow you know that a thirty gram carbohydrate breakfast would be an improvement on what you w:ere doing as far as ʔuh dropping it ⌈ down a little bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ and yet it would be s- it would also be something kind of easy to do with toast or br⌈ea:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Ri:ght.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: or English muf⌉fins so you could just l:ock into that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And uh see see how that goes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um uh: mid morning well that's kind of a debatable one cause you don't really l:ike to have the sn⌈ack.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ bu:t try it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Maybe carry something with you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And it could be something simple.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You might make this just sort of a a plastic baggie full of crackers.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That you take with you wherever you go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: and just make it a standard h:abit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: M:hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Or it could be a piece of fruit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That is gonna be: approximately: in that ballpark.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And lunchtime?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I I would say maybe rounding it I might round it to sixty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So so what if we increase your quota up to about five per⌈cent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It's ⌉ not a big deal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That that's not the most important thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: The main thing is that you're trying to hit those quota:s cons:istently.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m he:re I don't think you'll have any problem eating something % laugh later % laugh ⌈ on after dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: if anything it's ⌉ it's gonna be: trying to maybe keep this: dow:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Around fifteen to thirty or something in that ballpark.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But I agree that if you can make it a l:ittle mo:re rock steady you should be able to smooth some of these things out a bit more if you have a schedule that you're trying.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: to to go for.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But these are a little bit more scientifically ⌈ derived.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ⌊ Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: based ⌉ on ʔuh: what insulins are doing a- a- and when.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Questions.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔUh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: No I'm just I was just looking at this number and thinking Oh if I only eat that amount of carbohydrate at dinner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: I'll be just like dro:pping:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: A:ll night lo:ng.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: With your
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: And and that is so: annoy:ing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: It's like you have to keep eating and keep eating.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Cause I've had that happen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well maybe realistically what you wanna do is keep this one ʔuh because lunch well what are you gonna have really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You're gonna have yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: A couple tortillas or maybe a sandwich or something along that line.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Maybe realistically this is only abou:t forty or fiftyish.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So that's fine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ʔuh I would just adjust this to: fifty or five or whatever you see ⌈ fit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ But dinner you're right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You have control in that you: have a regular sliding scale that you can use and maybe b- realistically you should make this seventy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And just but but call it seventy and then r:eally try: to stand by that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And l:ook at the insulin look at your numbers before and after and what does happen over the course of the evening.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um do you have to go ahead and have this within two hours?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌈ Or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌉ uh: ʔuh or what.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: But but look at it and see but stand by it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Make it like seventy and then just stick to it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: ʔuh ʔuh Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: U:m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: S:o.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That's something you could play with for uh a little while and see if if it um helps in: getting rid of some of the outliers.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: That we're trying to fix up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So: u:m other questions:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Uh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PAIG: .
