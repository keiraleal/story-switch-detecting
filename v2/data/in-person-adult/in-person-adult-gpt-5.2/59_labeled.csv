out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: They teach like as if of they were a professor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: For lower level: u:m classes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Classes that are just like ʔy- ⌈ you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Just taking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: relative⌉ly beginning like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: If you took first: or second or third or fourth semester of a language?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: N- then you probably will have a TA.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: If you take more advanced.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: like literature courses in a foreign language then you have a real professor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Do they pay them very good?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Uh: We:ll.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: They didn't pay you very good when and you

out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: don't they ⌉?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yeah::.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Teaching degrees.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well I ʔuh like at Marquette.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: If you're a TA you get free tuition.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And if you're a TA it means you're going for your graduate s:tudies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Now So they
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: if you get f:ree tuition at Marquette I mean that's.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Yeah that's a- quite a bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: That's like probably six thousand a semester or something like-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Mm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Something like that.

out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Nope.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Arizona?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Arizona State?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Mhm it's his second year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: What's he teaching how to be an asshole?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: ⌈ Now We:ss.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: that isn't nice ⌉.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: He i:s teaching he's teaching something abou:t business and well what he's in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Recreation?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: ʔuh I mean uh not really the recreation part but how you keep books and you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Ye
in,FALSE,TRUE,WESS: You know what gets me he
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: He keeps all the books you know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JO: And put- pays all the thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Well he's.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: They say he's very good at that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,WESS: He makes the budget out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: The budget.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: That's it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,WESS: And he's rea:l good at making the budget out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: But if he's gonna put something in the checkbook and it's eight five he just puts eight dollars or nine down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JO: Sally
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: He isn't allowed to have the checkbook.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: At home but he
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: And he's really good at making out the budget.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: But the budget he's good at.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JO: So that's what he's I think what he's teaching.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: You know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JO: How that you would go about making out budgets for big organizations and stuff.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: I'm not for sure.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: Well a_lot_of people just don't really keep track that well of their own checking account.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: Yeah but you gotta though Fred.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JO: You wouldn't know: exactly what you had in there.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JO: Now if Patty is off one penny she will not go to % laugh bed % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: She keeps going over and over and over.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: XXXXX.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: till she finds that penny.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: I have not balanced my checkbook in seven years.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: So where do you
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: How do you know that they aren't cheating you:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: So what do you do just take their word for it?
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: I look at my bank sta- bank statements.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: look through my checks.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: When they come in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And make sure that it's fine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: But I mean they could be cheating you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Couldn't they?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: I mean they can m:ake mistakes too.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I know but I will go I will check when the the statement comes in and make sure that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: ⌈ Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: they've only deducted.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: that they've ⌉ and they've deposited.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know for the checks Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: But you don't go through and and check every check off?
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Penny.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh I do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: I'll
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Let me tell you something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: How bout you Cameron what do you do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: When I did take care of the checkbook.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I'm gonna start a club.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: For my mother you know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: I didn't do it either.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh you wrote down what sh-.
in,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: I wrote down everything but I was more like Neil I didn't write down the god damn pennies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh: well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: that then you know it'll never balance if you don't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well I: think I'd always like round high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: If it was like ni:ne twenty I'd put ten dollars.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: See I never basically.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I just never did it I always make sure You have to have a b
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: a minimum hundred dollars so that you
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: In there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: in your checking so that you don't get charged interest.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So I always make sure I mean so you don't get charged for writing checks and stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh: I didn't know that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Maintenance fee.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I always A maintenance fee.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So I always make sure I have a minimum dollar balance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Well see now we don't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So then I
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Cause we're over five.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Cause I never s- and I've basically have never bounced a check cause I always make sure I have that dollar balance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: I'd hate to bounce a ⌈ check.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I've never bounced a check.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: cause ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I keep
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Well you wouldn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: If you're keeping a dollar balance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's why I don't really worry about what I write ⌈ out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: But I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I just ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: You know I wouldn't.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: but I have like I had like I have a savings account and one time they took money out of the savings account.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JO: And put it in the checking.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: To cover the checking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Oh::.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Well that's okay too though.

out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You can make that recipe be completely done in fifteen minutes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And then you just let it sit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Ah⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,WESS: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: now ⌉ d- ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: See some of it he don't like the kind that you don't cook at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JO: Cause he said it's too
