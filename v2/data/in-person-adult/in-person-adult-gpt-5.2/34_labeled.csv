in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: And basically needed a place to stay % laugh because he ended up in town with twenty dollars.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: And I mean couldn't get to Amherst cause of no car and no buses and no hotels that were open and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: You mean buses weren't running then?
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: etcetera.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Hmm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: and he wanted to know if I knew anyone who % laugh would % laugh put him up.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: And I referred him down to Paul.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Cause I just and then I felt like oh I wanted to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: but at the same time I thought well that's a better thing and should we talk to John about?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: And I also just wasn't quite comfortable?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: But at the same time I would have been comfortable I think.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So: I don't know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Je ne sais pas.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: Oh the other thing I found out I h- was returning the book on uh housing?

out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oo.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: She deals a lot with alternative kinda housing and housing and housing for the sake of people and stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: So we were talking about that and then while we were talking about that um a lady came to buy something an:d sh:e s- gave me the name of this other
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: This Amherst architect who s
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: started two housing developments in this area.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Hm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: It % laugh was just so funny to and ʔuh Jen and I put a note in the log.

in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: in the book checkout thing?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: By my the
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: So I wrote down the name of the book to check it out and she put a note said oh: neat I've got a friend who's in a housing: place in: Denver.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: In like Colo- s
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I think it was in Denver.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Uhuh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So it was pretty wil:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Uhuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I have to pee.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Ohʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: xxx my shoes first I'm so tired.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So: so: so: tired.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: I didn't buy any books.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: I couldn't decide what I wanted and then things just got too harried and I just didn't think it was the right time to buy a book.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: We got more stuff for your da:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: What kinda stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Umm: computer access: places.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Like places you could plug into?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: xxx xxx
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Plug in to get email and stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: or
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Aw:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: And I also fiddled around and figured out how I can get things to print out two on a page.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oo:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: S- take up less paper?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Unhunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: You need a magnifying glass but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: No I think it's okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: In better li:ght.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah we have to get a light.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yʔʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oo I have to go to the bathroom really bad.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Take this back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I gotta take my sock off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Be right back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Yes lighting is an issue that needs to be addressed in this house:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So: it seems like a fairly basic one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That we could address fairly easily ʔuh ʔI was thinking we should walk down sometime to h
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: to the umm eeya eeya eeya to the lighting place down by:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm why don't you just go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Well because I wanna
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I wanna do things orderly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Sorry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Scott?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm?
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: I used the rest of the orange juice but I put the container back in the fridge.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: So that we don't have to wash it you can just make more orange juice tomorrow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: So far the cheapest place I found in here is: in Portland Oregon.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: How much is it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: It's like six dollars a month.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That's okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: See the thing is this light it's cute there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: It's not particularly practical there I mean light does come through there but if you're gonna sit there and read you need light.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Next to itʔ.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Well would it work to put it on the other end?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: It wouldn't be as:
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: It wouldn't be as aesthetically pleasing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That radiator tilts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: So I got to look at the copy of umm it's: Dante's Inferno.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: It's a new translation with twenty different contemporary American poets?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Got different cantos?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And translated them?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And so it's neat.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Cause there's these poets that I like.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And they've done translations.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Of these different
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Of the different cantos or cantos or whatever toes.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And um they: well it's expensive it's expensive but it's hard cover.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And it's nice.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: And it matches kind of this bath book this scented bath book that I wanna get.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: And I wasn't pla
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: I don't really nee:d it the Divine
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: I don't need either one I wasn't urgently planning on getting the Divine Comed
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Theʔ
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: The: Inferno one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: But the way they look together is very nice.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Those two books together.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So I was thinking it's sort of an aesthetic thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That it would be nice to get them together.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: At a time I'm gonna have a little vacation so I can sit in the bath and have my scented bath.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: And then I could read.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I do realize it's a little bit far out it seems like there's
in,FALSE,TRUE,KARE: Danielle said we need to the Alexandra Stoddard book back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Uhuh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KARE: They returned
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I think they returned the one
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: The Creating a Beautiful Home one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: The one that I had that had the the blue and red writing?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Oh uhuh?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: It's not there it's not in our inventory anymore.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Maybe it means that
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Maybe the paperback's going out?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And so they wanted to give the hard ba- cover back?
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I don't know I was very disturbed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I can always order another one if I need to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Is that a program you're reading?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Hm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Guess it's aʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: It was just a list of uh places that offer emails for- service and different things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oh: well that's good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oh: you know maybe if we could turn the spider plant around.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Which one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: The one that just looks kinda decrepit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: That one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Maybe we could
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: I think it would probably do better if it got its babies trimmed off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I mean can it wait?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I think we thought about doing that in the springtime then I thought we'd replant them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Yeah but I think there's more babies than we need.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Would
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And we've got three new babies that I could replant but I haven't already.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: And that
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Yeah the
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: The other plant over there is has lots of babies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Oh: I looked at Orlando today.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: The book?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Do you think you want to read that together?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That interest you at all?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Cause if it
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: If it really wouldn't if you're just saying that to make me happy then:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: No: I thiʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I didn't n: yea:h.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: I'm: I think it probably would.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: It seemed like it would be fun to read out loud.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And I don't wanna start it if we're going to read it together.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I don't want to start it on my own.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: I wonder if if it would be any less abstra:ct than the
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah there's a lot mor:e conversa
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: More.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: There's a lot more in the book.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Like the part where she falls on the ground.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Could be easier to follow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: and says I am nature's bride.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: she also says several other things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And there's also commentary from the narrator.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: After that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So I kinda like the movie better that way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Cause it's gets the point across:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Simply.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: So yeah there's more in it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Your basic account from Nea:r Net is two hundred and fifty dollars a month.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: That's a lot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: That's who S:mith connects to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Well if you're Smith it's one thing.

out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Well you can call Jenny.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I'm tired.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Maybe I'll call Jenny anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Jenny anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: any.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: any.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Jenny Garret.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Cause I wanted to ask her about the.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: magazines she's had.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Did I tell you that the woman who does
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: This book here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Monsieur ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Unhunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: This book here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Okay she did the art here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And other art?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: ʔUh it said in here that she does clip art.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: For different kinds of ʔuh liturgical things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And I found there's two books listed under her name besides this one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: But they are clip art books.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: One is for feasts and celebrations.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And one is for something
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: They're like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: They have neat titles.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: You just need to get yourself a: clip art book and a scanner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: And a scanner?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: What would I do with a scanner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: And then you'd like load em into your computer and make your things with them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Aw: yeah: then I wouldn't need a Xerox machine and tape and glue and stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: See then you could.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,SCOT: You could scan them and then you could make them different colo:rs and sizes and things like that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SCOT: And you could do neat things with them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Different colors and sizes?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: I'd need a color printer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Little minor
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: How much is a color printer?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: U:mm you can get a color version of the printer I have for: gosh I don't know five hundred dollars?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Would it be good?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: It's reasonable.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Look at this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: When does this go to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: We have to go far away away though.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Reclining love seat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Reclining sofa.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KARE: Since when have they started that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SCOT: Don't you remember we looked through like Sears catalogues and stuff like that and there was these.
