out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But if she ha
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ʔuh I mean it's not a big deal I just need to know if she had one done or didn't have one done.

out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: What is a brand inspection.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But it's

out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Registration
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: It's like registering a car.

out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I go through: ten.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Incredible.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Ten to twe:lve tons of hay a month.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Roughly ten to twelve thousand dollars a year of hay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: You must have been hurting this last season.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: No actually my hay supplier was real good to me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: How did you do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: I mean it was hard for everybody.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: I've been buying hay I've been buying hay from Bartlett's fo:r six years now.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: and I don't
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: I'm not his biggest customer but I've been real steady and real loyal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: We had a r
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: and I've referred him to a lotta people.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: We had a lotta we had a.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He kept my hay price
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: shortage of hay: this year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Because of uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: It was the floods out in
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But see he know:s how much
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: he b:uys a lotta hay he's a broker.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he buys hay And actually I usually get the Wyoming hay and it got ruined in the rain.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So I was getting West Cliff hay which I don't think is quite as good it's good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But not quite as good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But he kept my hay price down to a hundred and five dollars a to:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Which is how much.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: All winter.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Delivered and stacked.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Wow:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Was that a
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Which is really good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: What does that boil down to per bale.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Well he was selling it to: other people that came and picked it up for a hundred and five.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A ton.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But I get two: to five tons at a time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He just brings a semiload in here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: I'll bet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: What does that boil down to per bale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: There's Shiba.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Do you know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: No: it
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It's roughly anywhere from eight to thirty um bales per ton.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But I always buy by the ton because then I know how much feed I have.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: You know when you buy this much you can't go by the bale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It's: kinda silly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah: right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See there's Shiba.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hey Shiba?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Come here girl.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Are you sleepy?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And that's her boyfriend Beamer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's so
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's so happy he thinks he has a whole mare herd now to protect.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Al:righ:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MATT: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: She's been in high heat the last couple days.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MATT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He thinks that's wonderful.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Shiba's been in heat?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See how she
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See what she's doing?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Squirting on him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh: yu:ck.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Miserable old mare.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He likes it This one's in heat too and he won't pay any attention to her and she's really frustrated.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Cause poor mare she's been off her feet for two days because Beamer rushes the fence and b:ears his teeth and pins his ears at her because he d
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He doesn't want her to get next to his mare.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He keeps himself between his mare and and that one who might threaten his mare herd.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's really a funny character.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I give lessons on him too he's privately owned but his owner doesn't ride him much.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's real gentle.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He um he was shown out in California.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: xxx.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: he rides Western English and drives.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He pulls a cart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Wow.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's just as cute as can be.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's a little Morgan.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: They're identical color aren't they?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Unhunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And she's just su:re that this one's going to be it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Actually he's doing better than my stallion.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: My stallion can't get it figured out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's only ⌉ three.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And we tried breeding him to a mare the other day and she was going out of heat wasn't very strong And he was just a lot more interested in the Gelding next to her and I said this is what I need is a ⌈ gay stallion.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MATT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: A gay stallion.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Oh I said well that way at least I don't have to worry about gelding him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he'll keep: his pretty coat you know we just won't worry about him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's real even tempered but.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ʔuh We just had his first foal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He did manage to breed my old mare last year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But she's r:eally experienced.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And I just turned em out to pasture together for three days and she was patient with him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MATT: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But ⌈ then he fell in love with her and it was
out,FALSE,FALSE,HORS: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He was ⌉
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Um what do you call it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He only wanted the one mare.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He wouldn't look at any of the others last year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So we didn't get anybody else bred last year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But two is a little young to be asking anything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Watch this now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Watch him rush at her.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: rush at her.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See if he goes.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See and her buddy um the reason she's here this black mare she's here for board and training she hadn't been ridden in five years.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And her um pal of ten ye- ten years had to be put down a few weeks ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He just was so crippled up and old and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: s:uffering and she didn't want to keep the mare at home after they put the other horse down cause she figured she'd get frantic.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So she came here to have more friends.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: To make friends.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Well these are
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: So what did you do to your arena.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: U:m well last year I put in a whole new ring.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I spent about three thousand dollars leveling it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Because it wasn't quite level I
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I'd had it leveled when I moved here but it w- really wasn't level?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And the sand that I had in it ʔuh
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: There was natural sand in it when I bought the place It had all washed down the road and I p- think Kettle Creek scooped it up and put it in their ring So: it was hard as a rock.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: And it kept washing out.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And it was terrible and like riding on asphalt.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: So I had.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Well you were probably down to the hard pack.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: I was down to clay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: An:d I had Havens come out and
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: with a bulldozer.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: And he leveled the whole thing he took a who:le bunch out of this corner you can see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: ⌈ Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And put it down in that corner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd it just was a lot nicer.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And then I had hundred tons of sand brought in and spread % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It was great in the winter time?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: When it was all frozen and I had this much soft stuff on top?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: but when it thawed we couldn't ride in it it was this deep.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It was ho:rrid.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And the horses have had a hard time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Too much.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So today
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Finally it's been dry enough for Tad to come out and and take the rest of the sand off.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And I sold it to him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh he was taking it ou:t.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: He was taking it ou:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh okay I saw the big d:umptruck.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Well that was Havens was taking it out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Um Orville Havens.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: a:nd uh his son.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Which I can't remember his name.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Starts with an el.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Lenny or s⌈omething.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: And he was taking it to: someplace else.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Lenny and Orville.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He was taking it ⌉ to: one of my students who lives on the road behind me who put in a ring but didn't have any sand y⌈et.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: O:kay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So ⌉ she got a great deal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: She got about a third of my sand that I paid twelve or hundred dollars for delivered and she got it a- got about a third of it for about hundred and fifty bucks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hey: that's good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And so it was a lot cheaper than if she'd bought it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: cause I only charged her a buck a buck a ton which is what I paid for it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But then I had to pay a lot more to have it hauled in.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The hauling is what costs so much.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But I'll sh
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: So uh: yeah you know My my arena isn't very level.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Well it cost her a lot less to level hers but it wasn't as big as mine or as unlevel.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: This is my tractor.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It's masquerading as an Isuzu.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But it really is my tractor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Foggy meadows.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: My handyman did that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I haven't seen him for a while I think he quit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And didn't tell me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: That's my roommate
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: One of my roommate's horses is here and one's in there but he's hiding.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And then this is the field
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: This is what we call the witch field the mares live out there they get turned out there during the day and then that's the gelding field and my stallion lives out with the geldings And Bru:ge stands here half the day wanting to come in and then after he goes in he wants to go out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's like a lotta people's children in the winter time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: The mare field and the gelding field.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And the Chestnut
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: You see a dark grey on this side?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And then a chestnut with his tail to us.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The chestnut is my stallion.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's just as mellow as
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's mellower than most geldings.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's a sweetheart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd the mare and baby are up the road a half mile If you go through the gateposts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Th- where it says Stray Winds Two?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And just go through there and look to your left there's a pasture.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And I've got the mare and baby up there in a acre pasture.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And we've got
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Right now we're down to twenty horses here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Which is great.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And then my roommate's old horse is going out to pasture the first of the month too.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: He's um had a real rough year he had cancer a:nd he lost one eye and the other eye is going blind and this'll probably be his last summer and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: she's not riding him a whole lot.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But he's still pretty happy.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So we'll put him out to pasture and let him eat grass for a summer and see how he is in the fall.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And if he's if he's looks like he's gonna lose the sight in the other eye totally we'll put him down in the fall.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I'm not gonna let him wander around blind.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It's not fair to him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's been a grand horse.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But none of ours go to the killers at the end of their life.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Where do they go.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: They get put down and then either buried or just hauled off.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But we put em down at home.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I don't
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I don't put them through going out to the sale and being menh- manhandled and stuck in semi trucks and scared to death at the l- end of their lives.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I just.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: don't believe in that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: That's probably why I'll always be poor.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But I do a lotta horse rescue.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I've bought a lot from the killers.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Um in fact this black horse of my roommate's came from he was going to the killer's four years ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Not this one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The one that is b- blind now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he was considered a killer.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: An unmanageable.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's been perfectly lovely I give the little kids lessons on him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So I've had him four years.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: Sold him to my roommate a couple years ago it was her second horse.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd uh they've cleaned up in competitive trail and just had a great time and fox hunted him and He's just real game.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: He's a purebred Arabian.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: All bla:ck.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And he's just great.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd uh an- nother one I s:aved from the killers three years ago the l:ight chestnut with the blond tail swishing at us?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's a mustang.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he was four years old going to the killers out at Calhan and he was way down on the sales list and he was pretty spooky.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So I m
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I had eight horses at the time so I made one of my customers buy him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I said he's gonna make a wonderful hunt horse when he gets broke.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he did.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he's absolutely lovely and he now belongs to a old girl who competes him in hunter jumper.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Gee:s.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Nay:track and she hunts him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: That's great.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And she does dressage on him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he jumps great he does dressage he does everything you ask him to do except drive.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: We tried driving him % laugh I used to h- h
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Driving as i:n putting
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: loading him?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Driving him with a cart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: With a cart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: mean making you pull a wagon.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Yes making him pull a cart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Oh: okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: ⌈ Okay:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Well we did a:ll the groundwork.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: There's ⌉
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: This horse was doing great on the ground we'd harnessed him We'd been doing for two years.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: You know let's break this horse to drive.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Cause he's part Belgian.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's pretty cute.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's about a quarter Belgian.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he came from around Reno Nevada.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd uh so we did all the groundwork just had a great time with him a:nd I had this guy come out that drives Belgians and and he was gonna put in fence posts but the ground was too frozen.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So he said we:ll I don't have anything else to do and I told him about this horse he said let me see this horse.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he had Belgians he said wow he does look like a baby Belgian.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He's real cute.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he asked me what I'd done to him and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Baby Bel
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: a:nd I said well we've done a:ll this groundwork we've drug a drag with him and he's doing really good-.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So he put the harness on checked it all out for me cause I don't know as that much about it which is why I'd never hooked him to a cart.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: We just played on the ground.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd um he said well everything's good he:re and he drove him around put the drag on him he said oh: this horse is ready to drive I said are you sure?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I said when this horse spooks % laugh it's a pretty tremendous spook.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: I said and you don't want him to spook.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He said nah he's gonna be ju:st fine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He hooked him to the cart He got in told me let go I stepped back two steps the horse took two steps bucked kicked the guy out of the cart took off the barn door was open.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: This used to be set up a little differently.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: this fence went straight across and this was one big field?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And I had a different gate.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Because h:e destroyed it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He came % laugh out % laugh the end of the barn jumped a foot gate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The cart of course smashed the gate.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he went tearing around this whole field with all the other horses in here for probably ten minutes.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he jumped.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: With paraphernalia probably straps hanging to him right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The cart was still attached.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The cart was still attached.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: The cart went through the ⌉ gate?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Gee % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: The c- ʔuh the cart went through the gate knocked the gate flat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ʔI
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It was one of the aluminum type- type gates.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: like that little one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Only it was the big ⌈ one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: ⌉ And it was flat it was mushed that's why I had to get a new gate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd uh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Incredible.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: well I've replaced fences since then.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But he went tearing around scared all the other horses to death and there was a section down there which used to be a part of a fence You can see it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: See the part tha
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: It just makes kind of a down U?
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He jumped that with the cart too and knocked it over I mean he cleared it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: But the cart knocked it over.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And sent that all flying.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd finally the cart:'s wheels got smashed enough that it just wasn't dragging too well anymore % laugh and he was dragging dead weight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: And he fi- he stopped up on top of this hill and I was going h:o:ly cow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Golly day.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And in the meantime- I had a little mini about this big that was out there and he got trampled by the other horses.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: He was okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: He was on Bute for a couple days.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: And he liked it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Real strange.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: Give me my Bute.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: All other horses hate it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: But he got tram
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: He had hoof prints on his shoulder and ribs.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And another horse was permanently lame after th
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: He was borderline lame anyway he was doing walk trot and that's all an old lame Appaloosa but he broke a bone in his foot.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He just
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He made a sharp turn?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: On the hill and just
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He broke off a piece of his side bone.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: So he's retired totally now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: Just getting fat and not working.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd uh but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: So much for uh: carts.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: I walked up there and % laugh hoping he wouldn't run over me with what was left of the cart % laugh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: And I took a knife with me and I was a
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: And I didn't have to use it I was able to just unhook everything pretty quick and l:et him out of the shafts.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: A:nd um he h
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: The only injury he had And part of the time the shafts and it's a metal cart the shaft was under his belly and in between his front legs and I thought he's gonna tea:r himself apart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: No:t a mark on his hind legs.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JULI: He had a puncture wound on the back of his forearm here Small tiny puncture wound.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JULI: But it swelled up like that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JULI: He did a lotta bruising and muscle damage.
out,FALSE,FALSE,GARY: Mm.
