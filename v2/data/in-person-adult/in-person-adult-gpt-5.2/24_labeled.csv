in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: No I need like a little pin or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: You have a pencil?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: You have anything in your hair?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Fuck.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: What do you have to hit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔuh See this is the little
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Cool?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alrigh:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: See it was just slow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: This is me?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Is this me?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Jennifer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: That's right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: There you go thinking again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Smart ass.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Smart ass.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Who took over uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: They got North America.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: But not for lo:ng.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh: my God.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh my God did you see that?
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: Because player thr
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: player three is aggressive so he's gonna like go for everything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: How do you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Did I make him aggressive?
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah you made him aggressive so he's gonna like try to tear everything up now.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: U:m that's pretty well like secure right there so maybe
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's me xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh: fuck.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: Wow he wiped my ass out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Ah: you suck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Watch this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Looser.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: What else can we do tomorrow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: besides go to the movies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: t
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Go out to dinner?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm so: not hungry right now it's hard for me to think about food.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'd like to go out to dinner though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Think we can find a hot tub?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah that's a good idea.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's an excellent idea.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: There you go thinking again again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: There you go thinking again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm gonna whip your butt.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: You think so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: hunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.

out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's all I get?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's me right?
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Yeah you get a percentage of the amount of countries you own and then for continents you get another set amount.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So can I get something on this bad boy?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: See?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So I hit okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Hit okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: See you got one of each kind of card.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Ex:cellent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So I get.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So you got te:n looks like sixteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Sixteen?
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Who you gonna trounce on.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: That's you up there too right there you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's me right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: U:m.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: When w- you take over another person you take a
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: you get their cards.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: The MSG in that Chinese food really got me h:igh for a little bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Does MSG affect you?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Not really.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: It affects my mother.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Gives her headaches.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Are you gonna attack over there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Thirteen.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: That leaves me with thirteen.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: I wanna f:ortify.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: You can't move those to there because they're not touching.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: W- w- well that's kind of bogus.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: unh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: Maybe I'll move em right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Done.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: X Done.

out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: How many cards you have.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: You only have two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Just two.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So you can't have a set.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: When do you get
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: h
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: when do you get cards though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I don't understand that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Every time you take over a country you get cards.

out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Not until the end.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah we have to get rid of this striped guy first though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Is he the aggressive one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I don't know what player it is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Look at that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Are we not attacking each other until we get rid of the striped guy?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: It's up to you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: You make the call.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm not gonna be able to wipe this striped guy out yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I don't think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I'm
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I'm not gonna be able to either.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh man look at that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Totally wipe me out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: See if I wipe him out you're just gonna wipe me out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Which is kinda stupid.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: You can't reach that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: You gotta go through Iceland.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: There you go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I wonder if I can do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: o
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: no you're
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: you're not gonna be able to get through one and eighteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: You can get
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: you c
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: you might be able to get the single one there but I'd fortify down there because he's just gonna attack you again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: What a
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Look at me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Telling you what to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah look at you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I'd
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I'd put all your guys like right around there though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .

out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh you don't What does that mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I don't know what that mean
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh you can't do it after your turn is over.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: After you've already fortified.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Dang.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: My turn.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'd best have some cards.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Fuck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Shit shit shit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Shit.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: Oh I shouldn't have done that.

out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Look at that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: They won't let me lose yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Damn it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: One more.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Fuck.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: My eyes are getting heavy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: daisy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Shuffling the cards.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Tell you what I need to do here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Has to happen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: No way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I wanna just look at my cards here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Please Oh X but I got a new one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MAC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: Got a new one alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now if I can just get to the next
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Thank you very much.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: For what.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: I just took over Iceland.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh: fuck.

out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm f- so hurt.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ʔuh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: I can't believe you just won.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: I was gonna win the next hand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Quit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: You suck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Hmm:: You're so happy with yourself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: No: % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: I'm just happy that I beat you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: The Big Stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Hunh?
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Yeah the Big Stuff's all my Stanford stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Now what.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Backgammon?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: What's Hearts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Hearts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: It's the card game.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Put it up there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Wanna play hearts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Let's check that one out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: y_neat
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: wait play novice.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: I've never played hearts be⌈fore.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: You've never played Hearts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: in my life ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: No I don't know how to play it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'll teach you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Passing disabled.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That's you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Queen of sp
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔuh First lead rotates.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: First yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Always pass left.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So this is us⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Groucho Harpo.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔuh The object okay every ⌉ heart okay every heart is one ⌈ point.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Is tr
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: the q- ⌉ queen of spades is thirteen points the object is not to have any points.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: And you p:lay following suit an:d you can take if you take tricks th- the highest card of the suit takes the trick.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: If you don't have the card of the suit you throw whatever you want.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So h- hearts and the queen of spades.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Are bad.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: are the only thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: That are
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: that have points.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: That are points.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌈ So if you
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: if you throw ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔuh Look okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: y
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: so we got like three points right here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: we have three points in our hand exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: And we w- wanna try to get rid of that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: N_Right but we're pa:ssing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now the first thing you do is you pa:ss three cards to your left.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now these are low hearts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So I can
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm not gonna pass those.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm gonna pass the f- four of clubs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ All the
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: y- right- ⌋
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Why is that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: And these are two high
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: why
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: just because.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: And
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: cause you should always pass a club so that the person
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: so that the first hand ʔy- everyone has a club so that they can't discard a heart.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Cause you always assume that everyone's t
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: no one is voi:d of a suit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: The first time around so you don't have to worry about throwing a high ⌈ card.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌉ And then I'm gonna throw two high cards so I don't take those tricks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Because
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: But what difference does it make if you take a ⌈ trick.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌊ Well because ʔi
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: They're not worth anything ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Cause if I⌋: t
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: If I take a tr
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: the k- diamond trick and somebody didn't have diamonds and they threw a heart into that pile I was gonna take that with that ace.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So if I throw an ace of diamonds and somebody doesn't have any diamonds they're gonna throw a heart on me and I'm gonna have to take that trick.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay but but if they play hearts that doesn't
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: that doesn't win anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌈ I
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌊ If they play h
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: n_okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Just go ahead and play ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright ⌋?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So I'm passing three s_three cards.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: And I got.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: the seven of hearts three of hearts and the king of f- spades.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Begin play.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: The two of clubs always leads ʔuh I'm gonna throw the ace of clubs assuming I'm gonna take this ⌈ trick.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ Okay
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: no one have to ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: and then
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: and everybody ⌋
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So it's kinda risky playing the king since.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: But I'm gonna assume everyone has clubs still.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: XXX.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay cause there are thirteen cards I'm assuming it's an equal deal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now there are eight clubs out that means there are only f:our more left.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you don't
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: y
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: so you wanna play.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So I'm gonna
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: A high d
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: high diamond.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah exactly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Like a high diamond.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So jack of diamonds.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay ⌈ taken with:
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ Okay so he took that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now the ⌉ spade.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: so now ⌋
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now this is a tricky one now If I have a high spade now I'd throw it because I could take this trick and the h- my highest spade would be out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now I don't ever wanna take the queen of spades high spades are dangerous because you might
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: queen of spades is a hard cr- card to get rid of.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So if yeah okay I see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now I don't have
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: oh I do have a spade.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Well you're in a good position now because you've seen what everybody else has played.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: That's why.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌈ Diamond.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ So you have to play a diamond.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now h- ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Right ⌋?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right and there have been no diamond
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Has there been a diamond trick?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌈ There's been one diamond trick.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ uh: y
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: w- ⌉ only one though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah you played your ace.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Okay now it was le:d the spade was led but there's a heart in this trick.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So I wanna get under the seven.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Because I don't wanna take this trick.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Because there's a heart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: But that's easy cause I only have two spades.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: and they're both under seven.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: ʔuh so you would have taken that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: If I had a eight.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: So now you can still ⌈ get under that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌊ I could still get under so Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: too.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DAN: He's got an eight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you- ⌉
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: Now li⌋sten Okay now b- two different people took hearts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now if you t- have all
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: if you take all the points if you take all the points.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: All thirteen hearts and the ⌈ queen of diamonds.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So that's six points.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: it's called ⌉ right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: It's called shooting the moon and you get
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: you give everyone else six points or else you're minus six points.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: And that's good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Shooting the moon is really hard to do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now look it I don't have a club.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you can throw a heart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: there you go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: A high heart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I don't have a club.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now somebody else did take hearts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Or did he
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: or am I mistaken.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I thought ev- someone else did take hearts I think somebody else did take hearts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Queen of spades gonna have to come up m
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌈ n-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌊ There.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: there it is ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: He led ʔdid ⌋ he just shoot the moon?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I thought someone else took
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Ch
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So he got
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Groucho got one heart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: One.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: and Chico got five.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: So he's b- kinda bumming right now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So he sucks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So pass three cards.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So we wanna pa:ss.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔuh Alright.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Pa:ss so we're gonna pass the king of spades.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: King of dogs' feet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: How come you don't pass the king of clubs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I might.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: I don't have any aces here.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: I'm gonna pass a low heart.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JENN: Just so they can't shoot the moon.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I got the ace of hearts Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Two of clubs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: King of clubs.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Ace is out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So my queen is the highest there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright my jack is the highest there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you wanna play that now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Oh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Well I'll do it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you took that one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: But that doesn't make any difference ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now the two
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: See alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Diamonds are a- wasted.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Did you just take that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: That heart?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: No?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: No.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JENN: Groucho has the uh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DAN: Spades were ⌈ led.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: The f:
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So ⌉ you play.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Spa:de was led The ace.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: ⌊ Take
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Can ⌋ you play a club if spades were led and you didn't have.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I can
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ʔYeah I can
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: But but if you had hearts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: ⌈ Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So you can play anything then.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I can lead
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I can pl
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: th- I can ⌉ play anything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: So why don't you just get rid of high clubs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm thinking I'm gonna know
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: who's
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: G- Harpo's gonna take this so the points are split now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: So I don't have to worry.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Now the queen is the highest so ʔuh Two l
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: the two of hearts is a great lead.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: You can't lead hearts unless hearts have already been dropped also.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh: shit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh fuck.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I took a point there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm gonna take all: the rest I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: How can you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Maybe not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Oh: man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I knew it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm gonna take all the rest.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Fuck.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I just got like seven points.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: shit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: Eight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: X Alright I have no spades.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: This is a really good hand.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I have no spades whatsoever.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: It's really good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DAN: Play hearts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JENN: I'm gonna try to shoot the moon.
