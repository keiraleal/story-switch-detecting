in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And it's this beautiful attache leather.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: One that she bought just before she left.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: She couldn't get it open.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So Mike tried and he couldn't get it and I says uh don't worry I says we'll get we'll get one of the maintenance men I says they can fix anything.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: Or % laugh get % laugh one of the kids they could probably % laugh

out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I said % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: one of the kids could probably have it out in five seconds she's I know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: We won't
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: We won't test them.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: So I had Bill come over Bill comes over with his Leatherman Toolma:n or

in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: She's and I didn't bother.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: She just likes it with the handle not the shoulder strap.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: So she says it has not been a good day.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: My pants didn't fit and she says they're too long.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: She says I ha:te em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: They ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: You know and they were kinda long on her shoes?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And we were kidding her I says just buy real high heels and then you won't have to have em reshortened.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Her attache case wouldn't

out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: like I told you to yesterday?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: I took some this morning then too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: Just to make sure.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I think you know and you might be just a bug that kind of a flu achy type thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: ⌊ Yea:h.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: Yeah cause ⌋ Jenny had that flu today she went ho:me today: and a_lot_of people have had it b- you know the like s- fall
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: Paula went in and found out to the doctor she was tired of just having this kind of just not f:eeling real well and she thought she had an ear infection.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: she went in and she she- had a sinus infection.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Gave her some antibiotics.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: She goes at least I'll get over it then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: You know so I think it just might have been something around but God that was the weirdest thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: That's what I did all day today I had three or four different kids come up and complain of nasal sinus problems?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So every time one of the doc
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Their docs came on I wrote another order and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: I know it's just
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: called Bruce and added their name.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: It's just one of these long going flu things.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: Bruce wanted to go hunting today and every time I call him I says you're not getting out here early.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And then finally he told me he says uh he wasn't going today with Mike anyhow.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Mike left early.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And wasn't going hunting.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Today.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: So In fact ʔthen I didn't leave until f:- four o'clock.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And then him at the copier machine I said so much for getting out on ti:me on F:riday.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Oh yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Well I thought
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: I said Paula I can stay if you want me to.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: Cause I wasn't doing anything and we didn't do anything all day long pretty much it was boring.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: We had custom
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Can I just have a little bit of that soup just to try it?
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I tried
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: It's really spicy Annette.

out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: That's alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Da:d ʔuh doesn't cut up his onions as s:
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: ʔAs smooth as I do?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And I think when I made it I used my salsa not his salsa?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Yeah:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And when the chili powder says two to four teaspoons?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: He used the four?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I probably used two.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: He used the four.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So it's real It'll open up your sinuses.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: Well I like
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: I like the onions.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: I just wanna try it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: It just smells so good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Well try a couple spoonfuls.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And I think I'll only cook it for about another half hour and then I'll turn it off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: Um because % laugh well we had customer appreciation day.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANNE: So we had hot dogs and then we had the retirees come and they're really nice ladies.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: And we got corco- corsages for em and stuff you know they really like that.

in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And she said but that's scary to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Oh: yeah:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And she says so the opportunity the patients are there.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So it was a perfect opportunity.

out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: xxx xxx private practice.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANNE: When uh we sent Amy flowers cause she's staying with her mom now.

out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: You know no
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: Bugging and nosy and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: and I'm like I don't know who we'd wanna send flowers to cause they're both gonna drive each other crazy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANNE: .
