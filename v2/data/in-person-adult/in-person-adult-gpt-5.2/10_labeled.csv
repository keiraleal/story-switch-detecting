out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: what we were talking about was.

out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Uh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: Uh I would prefer that that you were there ʔuh on one hand because I think that it would be most expedient.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: But I think what was f:elt was that at this point rather than ha
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: than create
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: I don't really f:- find it to be you know a: confrontation by any means but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: I just think they wanna be able to just kind of ʔuh figure out I think our board eh quite frankly we have more problems to resolve interior than we do outside of it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Hm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: I think most of it is just attitudes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Hm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: I think ʔuh you know like I said what we need to do is this board has to realize in my opinion that that they have to come to grips with the fact that they are responsible for basically what they've created.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Okay You know ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: That's right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: but we have to realize that there's the faults here we have to claim responsibilities.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I think there was there's manners of- of speaking that I was very outspoken about at this meeting you know w- that I talked to uh Bill and Carmela and Nancy about you know and they

out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: and it was

out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Well that's that's the thing that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: but anyway.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: And what we will do is I think what we're gonna probably wanna do or what I would like to do is I would like to take a day.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: ʔd:- during the week and we'll just take a whole day.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: We have an attitude you know even what Ray's attitude with with Barbara.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.

out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.

in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: he feels there's a conflict.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: And uh it's definitely gonna happen.
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: I mean he says.
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: There's no question about it we've talked.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: Yeah and maybe it's right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Maybe it s- it is gonna be right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Well he
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: dʔ:
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: I mean he doesn't seem to
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: ʔuh ʔuh you've talked to him and I've talked to him and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Well he seems to be
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: I mean he says mayb
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: you know after the board retreat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: But not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Well I a
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: you know.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: I wanted him I said I want you to stay through the board retreat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I says and the reason is because I said we need people who know I said right now we have You know f:our new board members?
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Or five.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Four whatever.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Four new board
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And we're at this point of saying okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Uh: All of a sudden we have t- all these you know questions to answer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: we have all these things that we have to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: and we have this commitment of time.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Uh: ʔand but they don't know everything that's gone on ⌈ in the last years.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ⌊ They need to be educated as to
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: See this ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: no.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: no ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: this retreat that's why you see I think it's important.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Because I mean I realized that I'd never seen the bylaws since I was on the board until I asked for a copy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Now what I
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: what I have done though is to you know any new board member that jumps on I send them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ⌈ copies of the
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: because I wanna
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I wanna get these b:ooks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: but ty
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: typically they no one reads ⌈ em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Well that's fine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: You know ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: But it's
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: At least they've got
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: B:ut I think what I wanna do is I'm gonna
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I wanna draft a letter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Like I said which.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ʔuh says to them you know this is what we're doing this is the purpose of this retreat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: To new board members and you know board members for a while it was we need to find out what it is we're doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Whether we're doing something right or not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I think we are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: B- but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Sure we are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Sure we are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: the thing i:s ʔuh: I don't
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I need to b
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: them to kind of commit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: To to being responsible.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And uh I mean I kinda hate to feel like I'm taking charge but th- I guess that's what I'm I'm needing to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Well yeah for
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ⌈ You know but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ⌊ y- y- you do and you're
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: and that's kind of why I'm ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: and you're present ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I'm going to assign things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: you know at some point we're gonna ha:ve committees and we're gonna have you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ʔb:- people that'll be given tasks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know Specifically.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Like you know I didn't need to do all this calling aro- to find a r- a r- retreat space but I figured if I don't do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: That's right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: it's gonna fall on you or Pat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Of course.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: And normally that's ⌈ that's what happens.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ʔuh: That's okay but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: I mean ⌉ uh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know I I'm a- I'm a
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I'm aware of a_lot_of the things that are going on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You ⌈ know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I know that ⌉ you're getting ready to leave and Pat's doing things so I'd better let you go get her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: I know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And we'll continue this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Well yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: There
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: In some manner but we don't have to talk about it at lunch if you don't want.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: But I ⌈ think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: No that's fine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: if we can ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: That's fine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: If we can go ahead and carry on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Um.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: at some point you and I I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Because
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: One thing that comes to mind is is the well the question of meeting quarterly is that enough.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Meaning having you know the
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: It would be enough if committees were to meet.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ʔuh uh If committees yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: and that's the
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: but
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: that
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: that's
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: that was Paul's uh desire.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: was uh
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: that's what we wanna talk ab
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: we'll talk about that there too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And say look.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: you know is quarterly
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: you know we- would we need to meet every other month.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know do we need t
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: do we need to meet you know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: as a full board every oth
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: wʔ:
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: We shouldn't have to.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: We shouldn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: If the committees ⌈ uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: but these committees need to be active.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: function properly ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: and to do their things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Basically you know the publications committee needs to be more involved than just making decisions on what we publish.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: They need to become somewhat sufficient.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Collections committee.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: needs you know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I would like to create collections committee to be something where we're almost matching?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ʔuh Funds they can raise maybe?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: If they can raise ten grand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Well % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ⌈ and have some
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I mean realistically
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: have some ⌉ incentive.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: For them to
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: So that basically they'd be they'd get to a point of saying.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Okay we need to be responsible with this so that collections.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: and publications will be all fund raising too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Oh boy Phil that's
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Yeah it's not gonna be pretty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah that's where
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Because that's
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: You know also we may consider you know we have one board opening.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: And I
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: we may think about Gail.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Well Gail is very interested and so is this
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: we met with another person by the name of Bill Ashby.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Hm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah I know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Jack and I and Jim met with him.
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: Oh you mean his Jack's financial friend that
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: Jack's friend.
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: is retired.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: He's a banker.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: and he'd be good on one hand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: But.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: I would like ideally xxx I'd want em both.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: And I'm hoping.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah I
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: what I'm gonna
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: what I'm anticipating doing is ʔuh
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: this retreat might urge people to say I'm not interested in doing that much work.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: And so I'm getting yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: And it might just f- get like Nancy and Kay I mean I like Kay xxx.
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: See Nancy was going off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: She
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: she told % laugh me % laugh she was going off this year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: And she uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: and Kay convinced
in,FALSE,TRUE,BRAD: said well Nancy you can't leave right away and uh uh: she said okay I'll stay another year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: But I don't know why.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: You know and
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: and then we can
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: ʔuh: why
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: tha
in,TRUE,FALSE,BRAD: I think that's: very important to discuss.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: At the board retreat.
in,FALSE,TRUE,PHIL: I think it is because I mean the thing is that we need to get to a point and the reason we've set terms is because basically people here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,PHIL: majority of us have been here a long time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: That's right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know and there's a point
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: well that's why we have this the term limitation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ⌊ I'm
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I'm ⌋ uh full agreement cause I'm ready.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: I've agreed to do this term.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: my feeling is I'm ready for a year off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: a:nd I'll still be volunteering but I really am ready fo:r some time to say.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: You know and I wanted Jim to consider being market manager even if he goes off the board.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,BRAD: I know he was wavering a little bit % laugh on % laugh that whether or not he would volunteer at the marketing center.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,PHIL: ⌈ I mean there's ʔuh:
