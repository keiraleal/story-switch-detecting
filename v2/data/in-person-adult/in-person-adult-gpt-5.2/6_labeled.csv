in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: There are three shows in trouble.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: He was not allowed to help on any of em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: None of em.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LENO: That's changed now though he can ⌈ be like he was before again.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LENO: edit ⌉ and the neurotics are out.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Well what's gonna happen that he is editorial.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Period.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Cause st- Stevie's supposed to leave in February so unless they f
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: they
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: They have to look for an editor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Rosenblum's coming back though isn't he.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I don't know what he's gonna do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He wants to work actually features.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He doesn't really wanna do TV.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I went and saw their house the other night.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Where is it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Their new house.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It's u:m you know where Beverly Glen is?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It's one of those streets off of there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It's a nice little ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: North or south of Sunset.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Oh south of course.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Way down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: They're right off of Pico and I know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: How crass.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: True cuz.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But it's in
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Right next door is Ted Rich who's uh: one of the biggies at MTM or Lorimar or MGM oh I forgot which one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: One of them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ⌉ One of those places.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It all means the same to me:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ⌈ You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I can never ⌉ tell the difference.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: MTM MGM ⌈ Lorimar.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ⌊ Except one day.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: ⌉.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Hector ⌋ was s
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: you know they were scoring?
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: the show last week?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: And I
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: and I called up to talk to him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: and I could hear the um the musicians in the background tuning up their instruments?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: And then you know and it's okay to talk to Hector I could hear him a little bit but not too well but you know I still could tal:k to him and the next thing you hear all these h:or:ns blar:ing.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: So he said Lina I have to go:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: No: shi:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I can't hear you at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: sweetheart.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Call me when I can hear you.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: It was funny.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: That's the only part I'll miss.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: So X X
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: but X
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: His position is pretty uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ʔuh stable.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Fletcher
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Well see actually Fletcher was going to ask Hector to move back to editorial but he didn't know how to approach him cause he thought he was so thrilled about being associate producer.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But Hector really ha:ted it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: So Hector's the one when was it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Two weekend
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Two weekends ago?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Or last weekend.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: c- he said
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He looked at me and he goes p_so.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Lina what happens on Hanukkah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: And I was going I can't exactly remember the story but all I know is you light a candle and open a present.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: And he goes so if I call Fletcher it wouldn't be any great shakes and I said nope.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: I said what h- he di
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: never told me why he was calling up Fletcher so ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: um Sunday he looked at me and he goes I'm calling Fletcher I want to go back to editorial.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I said okay go ahead.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: So he called Fletcher and Fletcher was so: relie:ved.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Cause he wanted to ask Hector to move back to editorial.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: He's just happy he did it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LENO: Why did he want to ask Hector to move back to editorial.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Because he's so unhappy with the editorial staff.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: That they couldn't get what they wanted out of Sherry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: and they couldn't get what it- they wanted out of Seppie.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It's actually not Seppie's fault it's kind of they needed to work with him more but that Sh:erry was impo:ssible.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: She was a witch.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: And then her assistant pulled stunts where she didn't do stuff that: everybody knows assistants do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: which I wouldn't know but- cause I'm no assistant.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But things like making sure that the script gets to the people doing the sound effects so that they can follow alo:ng and make certain that their: sound effects are going in the right spots that kind of thing?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: She totally screwed up the- the show that they're working on now I don't know what number that is.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Sylvia.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: What show is being shown now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Well it's the one they're working on v- the one they're working on's not always the one that's being shown.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: But what one is tonight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Tonight?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Four?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: ⌈ Five?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Six ⌉?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: This i
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: We'll have to ch
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Oh this is the second one in the new sea⌈son.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: but I ⌉ don't know if this was really number two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Hm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: how they placed it or if it was like like you said number three four or five.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Because they had such a b- hard time with it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Like last week's wasn't supposed to be shown even though it was supposed to be number one because it was so poorly done.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It had so much wrong with it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Hector kept trying to get it corrected like a month ago?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: And they kept stopping him stopping stopping stopping stopping.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Cause of her.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Cause of her: cause of Ja:ke.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: Nixon.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: He didn't want him to do it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: And it makes him look like an idiot cause he's the director and you can tell where he:'s missed the shots.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: Has n:othing whatsoever to do with anybody el:se.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: It's Ja:ke.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But he'll s
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: He'd cut off his nose to spite his face.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: That's s:tupid.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: So now Fletcher's starting to realize what's going on.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: It's hard because the h:atchet man actually in the group is Ed.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Ed's the one that'll come in and he'll go ahead and say this is what needs to be done.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Okay and h
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: or he'll look at you and he'll go that was a s:tupid thing to do why'd you do that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: You know makes the editor really stop and think.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Or makes whoever it is stop and think the director.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But Fletcher'll kind of sit there and kind of go we:ll m:hm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Well let me see that
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: that seemed to be okay: but I'll have to think about it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He's real washy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: He's too: uh namby_pamby.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: You need somebody to come in and go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: t_So: they're kind of suffering that
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: ʔuh from that this year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Not having that on there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: But Fletcher's having to learn how to be more assertive.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Otherwise his show's just gonna go down the tubes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: And they can't afford that right now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: How many countries is it in.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Do you know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: m.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: All I know is Cathy saw it in France.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Oh really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIN: I forgot what it's called.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Something
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Huh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: It's about
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: has to do with the bar generation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: Um.

in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: I know: cu::z I know I thought that was really funny.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Dorks.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIN: The Generation.

out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: Yeah:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: And Cathy said oh yeah supposedly ⌈ Alina's been on this diet and lost weight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LENO: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: She said ⌉ oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIN: You mean she's not so ch:ubby?
