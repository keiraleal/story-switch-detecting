out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: One: large loan renewed a hundred seven: thousand a hundred eighty dollars.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: It's on Gerald and Pamela.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: They've paid they've reduced no problem.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: He's handled his line of credit as agreed so it's pretty routine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Joe?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: First loan request I have is: an existing real estate mortgage that will be refinanced into the secondary market of Fannie Mae.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: Customer is Gerry and Pamela Tucker at one eight Main Street in Hillsdale Illinois they're requesting four thousand dollars on a year Fannie Mae fixed rate loan this would include the cost of doing the refinance appraisal title work and points.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: four?
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Eighty four even.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: Their monthly payment of principle interest taxes and insurance would be seven one nine based at the current year rate.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: They estimate the value of their home to be hundred and ten thousand dollars.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: We had an appraisal in nineteen one by a certified appraiser that indicates the value of the house was a hundred and three thousand dollars.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Eighty percent of that would make it two four.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: So u:m in order to make them a loan for four thousand it m:ust appraise for a hundred and five.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: So that will be will determine whether or not we can go the full four and whether they have to come up with some money out of pocket.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Their assets total one sixteen four seventeen their: liabilities eighty three their: net worth one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So all they owe is the house?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: They um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: T T T.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: currently have a debt to income of eight over seven and after the refinance they would have a debt to income of fifteen over three.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Where are they now I missed that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: They're fifteen over
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: No.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: It's ⌈ as high as it could go?
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: ⌊ See so they're well within.

in,FALSE,TRUE,KURT: I always heard the ⌉ figures and never did know what was high and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KURT: low don't make any difference.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So you said they're gonna be fifteen?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Fifteen over three so their debt to income isn't a problem the uh: problem as I see it is the value of the house number one and the second matter at hand is that in nineteen seven they had filed a chapter eleven.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: They had at the time a mortgage with us They reaffirmed on that mortgage They were never late We: uh After that discharge we even advanced them money to purchase this house on Main st- Street here in Hillsdale and um they have never missed a payment on that loan I've also made them car loans that they've never missed a payment on a:nd um according to Fannie Mae guidelines as long as they have been discharged at least two years and reestablished and paid as agreed their credit obligations they would qualify for a Fannie Mae mortgage.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: With that in mind u:m I am moving that they app
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: uh that we approve this loan request subject to a uh: certified appraisal of their home.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Do we have the discharge?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yes:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: I have a copy of it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: When was it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: It was discharged on: November uh no.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Two three eight.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Discharge date was two three of eight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: When did they file.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Didn't you say they filed in seven?
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: Eleven of seven.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: In eleven?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.

in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: It was a business
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: No it was a business uh bankruptcy and it was pretty cut and dried they jus:t were eliminating the business: um debt and apparently nobody objected to the the bankruptcy.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Since they reaffirmed with their secured creditors.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: All the debt that was: charged
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: that was bank- filed bankruptcy against was unsecured creditors.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And they discharged em before they even performed or anything?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah in a three mon

out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: No I
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: I just it's unusual that they don't require em to
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: you know usually they put em on a year or year plan or something.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm See the- from what I ʔuh I gathered is the unsecured creditors got nothing and the secured creditors just carried on their payment history as agreed.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: As originally set forth in their contracts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: But you know usually the plan'll provide some period of time of protection.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: ⌊ Oh I

out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Well in that case.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: That's hard to believe because it says that notice of joint

out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: All in favor aye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Aye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: Aye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Aye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Opposed same sign.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Motion carries.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Is that the only one?
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: That's the: only loan I have.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: I got one small one.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: The only reason it's in here: is because the borrowers already ha:ve hundred three thousand borrowed so it has to be approved by the board but if we if Jim and Kurt approve it today that'd be two and then I'll have to call two more.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Uh: they wanna borrow f:orty f
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: Well Dave wants to borrow five hundred dollars to: finish paying off the renovation and upgrade necessary o:n the daycare.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: A:nd he had initially thought what he borrowed would do it and then he borrowed some money from his uncle and he wants to repay his uncle and get that out of the way.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: He wants to set it up on a year uh: it would be secured via three vehicles u:m you know his debt to income is relatively high but his income's going up the daycare is scheduled to open a week after: the fifth.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: So: around the twelfth to fifteenth of January he thought he's been
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: he thought he was already opened and then they came back in and told him he couldn't open.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Cause there was articles in the paper and they showed kids at the daycare and he had his ads out and everything but he didn't have all the i's dotted and t's crossed and state came back in and said we:ll no you can't really do that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So: one group of state people the people that do all the
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: do the testing for: electrical and safety and stuff have been there and now the state inspector's got to come in I guess they just look at the quality of the facility.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Not necessarily the wiring plumbing and heating but is it clean and is it safe and that sort of thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They're supposed to be there the fifth and he said that the lady told him that it usually takes a week for them to send a report in and for their license to come back.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So he anticipates that they'll be open no later than the twelfth to fifteenth he gave me some numbers I can't remember they've got like thirteen or fourteen kids they're already taking care of mostly out of their house until they can get em moved down there and then they've got eight or nine more.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: So they fully expect income to exceed the projection but right now they don't have any income other than from his job.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So uh: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: That's fairly large scale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: What
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: And he's gonna have five people.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: The building is
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: or something?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: At l east five children.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: five
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: See they're e
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: They're expecting that many f:airly quickly.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: And then he hopes to get up around fifty.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: See they're looking at four people plus:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: I've gone through the building.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: you know plus his wife.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: and it is: uh a r- very very nicely done operation.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: I mean there's nothing shoddy about the workmanship or the quality of the material or the cleanliness of the of the building.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Is it attached onto a storage facility?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: No.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: It's a separate building.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Oh it's free standing building.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Separate building.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: See it's a.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: It's a building his dad had where he was
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: where he had his

out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: O⌈kay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,"""FRED: +, ⌊ shop and ⌋ . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Okay ⌉.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: And was living in it and they converted the living quarters and all that into this thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: It's like anything when you're dealing with th
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: you know regulators and the state they you know he said they got two ladies for nine counties and they
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: There's a_lot_of this going on and they can only get to so many.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: So I would mo:ve since it's secured for five hundred it's on a month repayment which is relatively short I would move that we advance the funds.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: I'll second it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: Except they owe pretty much don't they?
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: hundred three thousand and some odd dollars.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: But he's always serviced I mean he's never been late he's always paid as agreed uh and they do have the income it just right now the income doesn't
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Well I say they have it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: O:nce the daycare gets up to twenty people they'll have enough income to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They'll fall back under the forty percent But right now they're over the forty because we st- can't show any income from the daycare.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Um but you know it it
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: you know I feel comfortable that it's there and like I say he's always serviced debt as agreed and and his overall debt is working down it's just quite a bit of debt.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KURT: You just I guess you can't say too much if they're paying on time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: Uh uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: and.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: And I think they're about to the point
in,TRUE,FALSE,KURT: as long as everything works out good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah I think if th
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: you know th- th
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: He's already talking if this thing goes like they think it is next fall he's wanting to start looking at expanding that storage facility.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: It's one of those things I think there's
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: they're always gonna have quite a bit of debt so long as cash flow'll keep up with it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Cause you know he's
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: that's: kind of their you know he's looking at that as his retirement income and an investment and this whole bit you know like some of the people do here.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: ʔuh Well it's been moved and seconded um to approve but that ʔuh we can't really disburse on that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: That due to his size of the loan.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: until we have all
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They need f- f
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: all the board members?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: majority of board member.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Four
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: uh f
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: At least two more board members because I'm voting.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: all in

out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: In favor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: See I was
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: since you seconded it I assume so are you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KURT: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: So see I've got two

in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: I was gonna see Wilbur but he didn't

in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: Any other loans.

out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: U:m what
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: what we have set up is Matt's going up to Chicago at LCL's office on uh for Monday evening Tuesday and Wednesday training.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The f
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: The Monday evening and Tuesday training will be very specific for him their workflow their forms he'll get to meet these people.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: On Wednesday then he'll be in a little bit of a larger group there may be four or five other asset managers with him discussing sails motivations and and and sales approaches and strategies ʔuh Larry said Ph- he doesn't know how Matt's gonna plug into us philosophically and how well he's known in the area.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: He said that's our decision.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Of which I- you know I'm comfortable with.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I wanted Larry to tell me how he thinks he's gonna do plugging into the selling and he said oh you
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: he should be
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: he should do very well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So I- I'm um tho
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: that looks good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: What I did kind of in regard to that was and I don't have this date finalized but s
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I'm trying to go maybe the second week of January to ha:ve a representative of Bankers Systems come here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: to do some specialized training within the qualified retirement plan area.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Matt needs Matt needs an understanding of not a detailed understanding but how all these qualified plans work so that he w- can have so he understands how his products plug into the to the directed IRAs SEPs and the like.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: We also it would do us good to know what products we can offer under those qualified retirement plans.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So uh R
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Ray Galino I I believe is his name is supposed to come down I haven't set up a date but he'll be here on a f
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: for a day and I wanted him to talk with Matt Vivian myself and sometime during the day to the two of you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Because as loan officers you have a good handle on borrowers and and can kind of tell them of these SEPs and some of the other products.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Uh we've kind of hesitated in in offering those.
out,FALSE,FALSE,X: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: well we have not offered the directed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Hm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: Offering the directed we're getting is simply we need to get a dif
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: fifty different forms.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: Instead of called an IRA it's called an IRA SD for directed.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And then that will allow people to if they don't want all their funds in a bank CD as as are custodial IRA arrangements.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: See the existing IRA says all those funds have to be in First National Bank of Hillsdale.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The directed the the participant signs a an investment direction or where where he directs the investments.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They sign the form and then you invest in whatever they want to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: xxx XXX ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Uh: the what.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: How that works like with the SEPs the SEP has a vehicle has to be connected to the IRA.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So we take the SEP off the shelf and then if the person wants that money put into a bank CD then we just use our custodial IRA forms.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: If they want a directed iʔ- SEP you take the same SEP form off but you're using a different IRA.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: You're not using the custodial IRA arrangement.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: ʔuh An SEP must have an IRA attached to it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So that
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So the IRAs all fit in the same plan.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They're just different ch- boxes checked off of this overall plan.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: And that the overall plan is what you're talking about goes back that's what the IRS has blessed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: is the framework and so long as you stay within the framework in some combination you're okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Exactly.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: So I I had talked with with Rick uh Brady today.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: and he's gonna send me those forms so we can take a look at em The other
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: The thing which makes it a little more complicated but it's really not a cost it's kind of a s- flip in that he recommended we don't try and do the account maintenance on those directed IRAs ourselves.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: Because of how complicated the law is in all this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: I mean coincidentally Banker Systems offers a comprehensive account maintenance services.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: You're kidding.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Isn't that xxx
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Well isn't that a surpri:se?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: That- that's such a surprise.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: And what- what- what we would do is they would take care of the account maintenance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: In a similar manner if you will a:s they take care of the the other qualified plans.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: We
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: We send them the information th
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: But they print it and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They crank out the numbers.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: qualify it and.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And and they file whatever needs to be filed.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: disclose it Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: It's really not gonna cost us it it's gonna be pretty much of a swap.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: Right now we use their hundred number a:nd their uh fi
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: their newsletter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: for the IRAs.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: We don't have their comprehensive service we have their IRA service.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And that runs about hundred dollars a year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: If you: go to the comprehensive account maintenance the hundred number is included and the f
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and the newsletter is included.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So we would drop hundred dollars off.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The account maintenance comprehensive account maintenance maintenance would cost us hundred dollars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But what you do: is they
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: he estimates it'd be hundred dollars for a minimal number of accounts Banker System charges five dollars an account.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And he said under a directed arrangement he's seen charges to maintain a directed IRA anywhere from forty to a hundred fifty dollars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Now I think a hundred fifty dollars is a lot to maintain a directed IRA.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: So you mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: ʔuh:
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: that you
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: w:e could pass that back to the customer?
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's what you're saying.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: We
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They charge us hundred plus five per account?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Well he- he thought
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: he's gonna send me down the information you know how the typical salesman they they they d:- talk in kind of nebulous terms.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: but he thought.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: w- they
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: they have a minimum number of accounts ʔuh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Oh with w
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: is covered if you will by the five-⌈hundred.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And so he said ʔuh ʔuh ʔuh way I understood it would let's say hundred would would cover the hundred which is very very helpful service.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and uh the maintenance for let's say twenty accounts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Well if we had ten accounts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: we would charge ʔuh hundred fifty dollars on ac- on an account it would be hundred dollars it's really kind of a switch around but what what that would
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I think it would be good for the five or six of us to to have Galino down here can kind of explain what products we can offer from the bank side.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Matt needs to know that and and we all need to know that and then we can figure out how Matt's the products that LCL's gonna offer will plug into that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And it's
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I was thinking of sending Matt up there for a week but you know he's up there a week he's gonna learn a_lot_of very technical information such as like those section fifteen XSes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: That that % laugh I was talking about.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: You really don't need to know the the technical nitty about it because that's what Bankers Systems does.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They take care of the nitty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Hm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So it's gonna be less expensive to have Galino come here instead of one person going up to to Minnesota for a week and then trying to bring back the information we're gonna have Galino come down here for a day and he won't
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: he won't touch any specific complicated items.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: Such as fifteen XSes or or ACP testing or that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: Cause Vivian and I kind of know that but if we don't know that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: like that fifteen uh XS.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: I called the hundred number and and they went through the explanation where the IRS changed the the deduction.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Just a
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Just a question.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: from a mechanics.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Who's gonna ho:ld the account.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: Is LCL gonna hold the account is the bank gonna ho- hold the account Who act
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: You know you're talking about bank products and and LCL products like before the trust department if you will held the account.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That that's physically where it ⌈ was.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: you know ⌉ Is is it's
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Iʔ- ʔuh: is the plan ʔuh ʔuh gonna be in the bank or will the plan be in LCL or is the plan ʔuh just kind of nebulous.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Well
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: well the the SEP and the IRA will- will be First National Bank of Hillsdale.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: That's what I meant.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But but tho- those
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: They're bank products.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: if you will.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: We offer those and then LCL if w:ill have within that plan they'll have things you can buy if you want to direct it that way.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: If you don't want a CD.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Tha- the
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: or if you: want something else you could direct that that the monies be used to buy: some mutual fund or some bond fund or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And how I envision that then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: we would get the statement from LCL for the mutual fund holdings let's say the person also had a CD.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Let's
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: You know it doesn't matter how they split it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Like we do now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And then then what what we would have to do is pull that information together.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: We would get LCL's statement as of the end of the year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: What the income was and what the balance was we would then have to if they had a CD pull that in we would report that up to Bankers Systems.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and they would then combine that and produce the report.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: It
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: That's why there's normally a cost in those directed because it's not with our CDs now that information that's the whole account and whatever's out there on the on the retire- on the RAP record just passes right up and and the CD and the RAP information r- retirement account processing system talk together.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: When you get another vendor in here like LCL we physically have to put the papers together.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But it's not that complicated.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: But the name of his office is gonna be LCL.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: S
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: It's not gonna be First National Bank.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The- the
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I got a f
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Oh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: Yeah I love expansions of business.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: It took me five minutes to get a phone number.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: The phone number by the way is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: ⌊ For LCL.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Five Five Five Five.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Is what the phone number will be.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: But this is things that I'm I'm anxious for Matt to get here because I'm getting I'm getting tuckered out trying to get all these nitty things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: It's not tough to get the phone number.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But see they need the phone number in order to order letterhead.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: in order to or- ʔuh have business cards.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: LCL in in Chicago needs that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: to get that process going.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: ⌈ Uh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JOE: Uh is there LCL accounts gonna be maintained here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: cause cause actually ⌉
in,TRUE,FALSE,JOE: I mean or is there gonna be a separate They're gonna have an account in Chicago for the funds to pass through?
in,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Or is it gonna be passthrough funds here at the bank?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Or is that ʔuh:
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Well w- what we'll do is those'll probably wire transfer out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Through Boltmans or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Well through the Fed what
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I think what will happen but we
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: Matt'll find this out and I mean we'll get involved in it and I'm
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I'm not
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: whichever way it goes is fine but probably the most sophisticated way will be everyone who makes
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: who buys a fund or whatever that money will go into a a clearing account here.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: And then we will either LCL will will ACH it out of us.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: xxx xxx.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Or we'll physically wire it up there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: You know there may be a hundred thousand dollars in there which may represent three people's or four people's purchases.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: and then Matt faxes the paperwork up to LCL and they do the suitability testing and then they know what products have been bought and then on the other side we do a wire transfer to physically get the money up there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I think that's how it's gonna work.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Si- similar to Fannie Mae.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Ex- ex
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Uh yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Sa- same- same- same type of thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,FRED: We we we collect monies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Custodial ac⌈count.
in,TRUE,FALSE,FRED: we collect monies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: and ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: put it in account and the:n we tell them how much of it is theirs and by calling up there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: XXX.
in,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: and that dial deal and then it- they zap it the next day.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I don't know if.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: ʔuh like that's the same way that uh American Express with the traveler's checks work.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: When we sell Traveler's Checks we put that money in a clearing account and then Jo Anne or Grace or: Tom or somebody calls whosever doing that job calls a number.
out,FALSE,FALSE,FRED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and we report how much in sales we had and they d
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: they d- hit the account the next day and take the money out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But that's
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: that's kind of the the mechanics of the of the flow of funds.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: But to answer your question Joe is that LCL that office will not say First National Bank of Hillsdale ʔuh or anything of the nature.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: ⌊ Anywhere.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Uh the
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: his his card will be: LCL investments at First National Bank of Hillsdale.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: U:m l:etterhead will be LCL there needs to be a separate phone line going to that office.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: And we'll
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: we'll be able- when we get this receptionist set up the receptionist will also answer it but when they pick up the phone you know we'll put it on a red line or blue line or something like that when they pick up that line like we do with with with Bill's number you know they they pick up and they'll say LCL investments.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They also
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: and it's also requirements by uh uh ʔI guess NASDAQ or whomever and the comptroller that they don't want us when that line rings we're not gonna pick it up and go hello First National Bank of Hillsdale and they go oh yeah I wanted to talk about a mutual fund oh I'm sorry yeah you do have LCL in- investments.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: I mean these are some of the nitty things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: They they talk about in the regulation and I'm pretty confident they'll they'll implement those out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Is Matt gonna carry on his other livelihood that he had before through that office?
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: Or is he totally out of the insurance business.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: N: He was meeting with
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: they had a regional meeting- or meeting with their regional manager today and he was going to to tell him that he's plans to take a job here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: C- Common courtesy says that he ʔuh needs to give em two weeks notice.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: But the- the practice within the the industry and Larry
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Matt said this and also Larry Harb said this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: So I know it's not Matt's employer it's just within that industry as soon as a person says I've decided to move on to another
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: another uh uh customer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JOE: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: or an- another employer.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: ni
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Come in.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,VIVI: Did you need to talk to Genevieve.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: N- ʔuh I'll g
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: see if she's gonna be at a number where I could talk to her in maybe a half an hour or five minutes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,VIVI: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: Or else I'll give her a call tomorrow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,VIVI: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: Um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,JIM: as soon as they get notice they typically: say well fine thanks for the two weeks notice but it's effective today.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JIM: And then they electronically transfer: his licenses to his
out,FALSE,FALSE,JIM: to to LCL.
out,FALSE,FALSE,@End
