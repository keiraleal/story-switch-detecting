out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: How are you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Are you
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You're the guy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Hunh:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You're the guy to talk to then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I'm the guy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: I didn't know if I had the right place.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah you got it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I just
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What are you doing there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: You're probably trying t
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah this is strange what's this guy doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: I'm putting water in a six gallon container inside my truck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That's quite a p
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: Cause I had to haul it to a property which doesn't have any water and I have to spray the road.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Ah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cause the road before you can drive on it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Interesting.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: it needs more uh
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: more stability.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Evidently.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So give me one second to lock this thing and then xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is that to keep the dust keep the dust down?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: well no it's not that so much it's uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: they put they put a: uh a type of uh base on it that needs water and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: that just hasn't happened yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I see.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So there's some chemical reaction that has to take place.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I guess a good a- analogy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Chelsea no.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That should hold it in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Nice to meet you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: How you doing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Good to see you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: What's your name?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Seth.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Seth.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Here's my card here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Thanks Seth.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I think it's warming up a bit here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is this the house we're looking at?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I'll take you down in the basement.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is the furnace down in the basement?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: What's left of it yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We had all these
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is it a ol:d system?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We had the asbestos uh all removed from it and and uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh really.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: so that's been done.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I was j
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I was just at a place that does asbestos removal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah where.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cal
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cal Tech?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: they're the guys that did it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Are they?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: that's down in Berkeley right?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: No they're
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: they've got an office here in Nappa.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cal Tech.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: What was the

out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Synergy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's who.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Synergy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Dif- different one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔI: I'm sorry.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It's a different outfit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I didn't know they had one up here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Though I think they had just recently mo:ved here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause I was wondering t
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So where's the man with the uh camera and the

in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I got my recorder right here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's pretty clever.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: Yeah my brother is uh teaches linguistics and I guess he's doing this study.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh: okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: and they just want business conversations.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Here's the animal.

out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: W:ow.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: They took uh some of it with em obviously.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Did this used to be

out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: I think it was an old.
out,FALSE,FALSE,"""SETH: +, ⌊ fire ⌋ ? ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I think it was an old see the oil tank here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Isn't that an oil tank?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's what my guess is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: A:nd uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,X: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Wow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: do you have a flashlight on you?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Sure do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So then you get duct work?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Or is this the flue.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We:ll yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌈ What they did.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: That's the flue I guess.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: they they ⌉ took the stubs and they cleaned em up.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: So you can tie right into em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: So this used to have asbestos.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Hunh?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Where did all this connect?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Was there a a plenum on top of here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: There was a bi:g hood that went over the top of this thing with these stack that went this way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah like an octopus type.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: and then one that goes back un- underneath there to the
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: to the: uh: kitchen there are- there are different
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: there are different ones that kinda go all the way up.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: I see one r- there's a rectangular one right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: is that one right there w- that I'm flashing my light on?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔYeah: it might be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔIt kinda looks like it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: And then there was
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: there's one farther up and then there is this one here.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: So you have one two three: at least two there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Three and then there's another one way down.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I don't know if you can see it or not but it's
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: it's up into the kitchen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So there's probably three back there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: and a
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: and any over on this side?
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: Well no but what- what we
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: we want to p- you to kinda give us an idea on a- w- what your thoughts are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You wanna add a c
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: add a few more?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Add a couple.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Back ee way back there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Is that one way back?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Can't see it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: xxx get this thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: To help
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: to a point.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: I don't know what this was looks like they
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: That was connected to one of em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: They left that here.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: I don't see any back in here but.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: Well there's there's definitely one back there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Now there's nothing out here and this is where we feel we we should add one.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: Is this is a gonna be a dining room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So uh: one for
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: one there for sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What abou:t uh: what about above this section of the house.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well let me show you that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: And you can give
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you can give me some idea about that as well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Now uh you are on propane?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: out here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: This is natural gas.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Kinda rare.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: That's good because uh the problem with propane is that they wouldn't be able to v
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the co
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the county would probably have a problem with it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause they're very concerned about propane.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But natural gas I can put a
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌊ Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: we were ⌋ real happy to get this place with natural gas.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Do you want me to remove the old furnace.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We'll not have to?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: No uh do you want me to remove it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No that's
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: that would be part of our deal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well y- the new furnace w- would be much smaller.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That much I can guarantee you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌈ Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌊ Do you

out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: How many square ⌋ feet is the house.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh: well I guess it's around eight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Approximately.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I have a roof guy coming about this time too so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You're doing the roof?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: doorbell rings we know who it is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Getting a new roof put on too?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well I got some problems with leakage in certain areas and just gotta get it fixed before we get the rain again.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright well let's start in the kitchen.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay this is
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: this is one right here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See I don't think you saw this one but.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm wondering if: you don't have a floor plan of the house do you by any chance?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We don't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We didn't get anything when we bought this baby.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm wondering if I should just sketch it out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It's story though right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: story.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Th
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Are there any registers on the second floor?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So all those s:t
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: all those s:tubs that were behind us are the ones that go up through the wall.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well that's no problem.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: as long as I don't have to do any ducting to the second floor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: They only
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: the only thing that we wanted you to do is tie into the existing ones.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: which are on the ground level.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: How about that one right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is that one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's one as well.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And then the return is back here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Good sized return.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Now you're not looking at ʔuh adding air conditioning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Right?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well we would like to have that as an option.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: X Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We could always add that later.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: One of the things you can do if if you don't wanna do it now you can what they call prep for air conditioning.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You can put in the coil.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: See you've got the furnace and the coil.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: and then when you add air conditioning in the future all you gotta do is put the outdoor condensing unit and refrigerant piping to that coil.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So it saves
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: it saves: additional work in the future.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Otherwise you gotta come back and put the coil in which means you gotta modify the duct work to get that coil in there so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: if you're thinking about doing it in the future you might wanna at least put the coil in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It only costs about hundred fifty dollars for the coil.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It's the it's the outdoor air conditioning that
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well write that in there anyway in the in the quote.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And now that's the the dining room you wanna add?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: If you
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: if you go over and have a look at the dining room.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You got a lotta glass in that room it looks like.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: yeah and ʔuh we're gonna be making changes to the to the house too so we're keeping that in mind.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: But if you notice there are no registers in here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is this accessible?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I wonder
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I wonder if was this added on you think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: maybe?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm just wondering if that foundation wall
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: M
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It might've been.
in,FALSE,FALSE,"""SETH: +, goes to that (.) I wonder if I can get (.) into this . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh you can get into it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I've been under here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So this is not a problem.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Shoot I'd probably go with two registers in this room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'd probably go like one here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: and one one there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you'd do one over there as well?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause it's a sized room with a_lot_of glass.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Or you could do it you know you could put like one on this wall and one on that wall.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay on the two two out⌈side
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And then I'd probably tie em both together.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: into one branch you know like the room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the room is shaped somewhat like this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I could put like one there one there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Now what we'd want you to do in this case is maybe
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: tie those together like that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See this this
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: The end of this room might be modified.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So all we wanna know is is that we can eventually be able to do this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: To to get ʔuh get this: duct work done when we do
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: when we do the modification to the

out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: X xxx do it in the future.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We m- ⌉
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh I I hate to see us do it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Where are gonna be your

in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well what would the modification be.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh we might take this out and we might push this out further and uh well here's the drawings right here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh: let's see: that's the guest house.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Where is that sucker.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Dining room?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah I
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It's right
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: i
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: here it i- here it i- here it is right here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is this the wall.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you can see that
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: this is the current wall.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: oh okay so are you gonna go out like three feet or so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌊ So we might

in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: we might ʔuh: ⌈ do a little modification.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: a tape- tapered uh corners.

in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So we might do a little of that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: But if you're gonna put it in h- this end wall then maybe it wouldn't be affected.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: That one might down there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Because we might uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: see well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See eventually we have s
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌊ you know you're right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause I ⌋
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: cause we're looking at right there course now you gonna go out

out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌊ that
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: it's ⌋
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: that that that's going out to this master which is gonna go up on the hill.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: Aw so you'll need
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What about heating for that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: Well what we're gonna do is put uh radiated heat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: In- in there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: That'll be a slab floor then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: For sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: So that one might change.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: uh:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: I- that's a that's a good point.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I've I I'm not uh we were th
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: The only thing i:s I don't know how long is that gonna be like in the future like a year down the road?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Probably.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: Cause it would be nice to have heat in here in the meantime.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean say you do the furnace It would be nice to have it for this winter.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: Well let me work that out with my wife.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Put that as a
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: But one thing you can do even if you do a modification you can move the register.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean say we put the register right h:ere and that's gonna b
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ʔuh: that would obviously have to be moved you know it's not a big deal to move it from here to here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You might have to add a piece of duct work but it's not gonna be a major change.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And this one you may not have to move at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That may be okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But then that's probably how I'd do it some- something like that or if I had the registers going that way that might be the best way to do it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It'd be like for- fourteen by six.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean that would probably be an inch duct that'd be an inch that'd be a inch and then the furnace I don't know it's somewhere over there in that area.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Furnace: is:
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm not sure how many feet.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well the furnace sits down over in this this corner over here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's where the furnace is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: One.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Two.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Probably right in here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Three.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And now

in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That's a loud one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Is it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Really.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I've put a few of those in and they.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Have you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I've had problems.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I wouldn't go with the Lennox pulse.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: If I go with a: uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'd probably go with the Carrier.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Carrier furnace.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: The return grill's plenty big enough.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It's a big ⌈ return.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌊ I mean I can't
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: you can't ⌋ have any kind of problem there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: and a ⌉
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: and and the pipes are big enough so: and that's normally when you get
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you get a_lot_of noise in the house.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Is if your:
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: if your uh ducts are too small.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah y- the two main sources of noise are either uh: air noise which is due to undersized grills.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Really?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: you got air rushing through there at high velocity.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: The other source of noise is th- is the fan motor itself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: In the- in the actual
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: In the unit itself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And that's usually solved by b- just having flexible duct between the unit and the d- and the registers so that it dampens out the noise.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: In other words if we had the furnace like right behind that wall: it would be noisy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But we're going d
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm not sure how it connects did we see that down there?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'll have to go down and take a look at that again ⌈ but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌉ I imagine it goes dow:n and then we can run some kind of a flexible duct to the unit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: As long as I can get say ten feet or so between that and the unit then I
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: You can.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: then I can: uh eliminate th- the noise problem.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So it's basically thirty by thirty return air.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Thirty by thirty return air.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And this is a uh: this is the only return and I'd:
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I would ⌈ say not
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh this is return also?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: not placed ⌉ not placed very well in the room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: This is
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: this is supply though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Right?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: this is the supply.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See and I'd
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Where would you suggest they would go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: If uh if we put uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Boy.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I would say g- I'd probably go with two.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'd put one on each side I'd probably put one like right underneath that window there and maybe underneath that window.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Be nice to put it behind the couch but then you've
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: it would be blocked off too much.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And you thi
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you so you you p- you try and put em: under windows where that's where your
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I try to put em on: the cold
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: basically the coldest part of the room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Because uh it just helps ʔy: because otherwise ʔyou know with a grill right here you end up having cold spots on the sides.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause what happens is the air goes b:ack to the return grill ⌈ so it never really.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It wouldn't get out circulating through
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: it never really blows ⌉ out to the corners.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So that's why I try to put it as far away on the perimeter and have it pull across the room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: well this is the on⌈ly
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So I don't know if you'd wanna
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔuh the only the only ⌉ other addition room where we thought maybe registers would be important.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And I'd I don't know if uh: floor registers?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Are there
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: are- th- i- i- i- is- d- does it
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: that's not a good idea these days?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: No I would go with floor registers in this house cause you got high ceilings.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔuh xxx.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well in fact you wouldn't be able to put any kind of ceiling register in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause you get the second floor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So no.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Floor registers are fine for heating.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: But th
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you're talking about wa:ll regis
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: putting em in the wall here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: No I was- I was thinking about putting em in the floor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh in the floor?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah to
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: to go in the wa:ll would be pretty tough.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I don't know if you wanna cut the floor though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well I hate to do it right there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: May- maybe we'd do it right in here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But to get in the wall would be almost
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean you can do that during new construction but it's tough when you're coming back after the fact cause you: just got.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Sure.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: your- your four framing and it's just too tough to get in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So we'd put a couple in this room somewhere?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And then uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So this is like a: family room?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Is that what this is?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh: it's kinda like a lo
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: kinda a little parlor library something resembles
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: XXX XXXX.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: This is a register so that's okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cause it's under there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: the bathroom has a register now that was it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: XXX.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: How about the uh thermostat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: This guy?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I would definitely go with a new thermostat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Kind of a ⌈ X antique.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌊ But that's probably a good
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: that's probably ⌋ a good spot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: isn't it ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah that should be in a museum.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Uh I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I- i- are we doing the right
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: If I'm supposed to kinda walk you around the house here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Is that what uh
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Do you think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: well I guess you haven't really
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I don't know if there's anything you need to do up here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Other than the fact just kinda know that we've got em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah you haven't r- really lived in the house during the winter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Have you?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌈ And that's what we th
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So you don't really know: if there's a
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: See and that's what ⌉ we thought we would do uh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So you're not really sure if there's any problems with heating certain areas.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: That's right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: so I sa
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So we don't know if there's any particular areas like that b
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I bet you that parlor room has had a hard time in the past.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Do you think it's pretty cool in there?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Just that one grill.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And then this guy has a register so.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh they got AC up here too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I n- I think that's gonna go.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well uh especially if you get the forced air heating and cooling.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: you won't need that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: One little guy there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah see these aren't strategically placed either but you've pretty much got no choice.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: On most of these these
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: it's almost impossible to to change these now but really on the second floor.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: This one's not too bad.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the heat the heat's gonna rise from the first floor anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah up to
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: You ⌈ know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So: I
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And it'll ⌉ hold it in here real well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Typically and- if anything you have ʔuh overheating problems.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌈ Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: On the second floor.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well ⌉ see that's what we wanted to do is have some kind of a system that we know we can shut off.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Certain certain areas.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Like if w
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: One of the things we could do I don't think they have any dampers here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Do they?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Oh they do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So you can close off
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌊ Oh okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So that's ⌋ how it's
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah you can close off individual d
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Close these off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: and then the
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: then it'll force the air what.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Down into
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Downstairs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌈ Now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the ⌉ one thing you don't wanna do though is close off: too many of em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cause then you put a strain on the:
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause cause then you're uh:
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: yeah you've gotta have a certain amount of air for the furnace to work properly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And if you reduce the airflow too much then it won't have enough air going across the heat exchanger and it'll
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: it'll overheat the heat exchanger.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So I would say.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: you don't want to close more than uh more than about five percent of em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Or you can close em ʔy: you know if you close em uh ʔa:- a hundred percent.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: If you close em all the way you probably don't want to shut more than five percent of em.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: All the way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Which would b
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'm not sure maybe all upstairs you might wanna leave em cracked open just a little bit ⌈ though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Unhunh?
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Just ⌉ to make sure you get enough air.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But okay so we'd be looking at adding two two registers for that parlor room?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Adding two to that parlor room.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And then what about that one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Do you wanna hold off on that?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well maybe we should jus:t
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Or would you wanna do at least one of em?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ʔuh: I think we should do something yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Only because
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Because if that remodel's a year away then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ⌊ I I th
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I guess I th
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I think ⌋ this thing is gonna be a cold little
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: oh I can definitely see % laugh that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I I I can tell you that because the windows.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: See you only like
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: the only heat you have in this room is that one register over there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: the windows in this thing are just a bout ready to fall out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I mean they're
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: they're not
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Look at this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So I know there's gonna be a_lot_of uh
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: A lotta infiltration.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Until we get this corrected.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: See hopefully you'll go with double pane glass on your remodel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Xxxx.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That'll help cut down a lot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: On your
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,"""SETH: +, heat loss . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So I mean ʔuh: in some ways having windows is it a bad idea?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Because you get a_lot_of natural heat from the the s- from sun.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That's right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay this is like it would get
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: This is like east facing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: The s- in in
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So you get some morning sun.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: You get the morning in the winter it's gonna come right across like this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So that's gonna be good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So that'll be good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So maybe one register in here for the moment until we kinda feel it out would be: uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Sure.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean this one it looks like if we put a register over here you wouldn't have to change it anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: No that that
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: With your remodel that might work into it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And like I say even i
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: even if you do have to move it it's not X a big deal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I mean somebody just moves it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: you know a carpenter can do it even.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You don't even need to have us come out and do it really.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You might have to add a
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: buy a piece of flexible duct and stick it on there but it's not a
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: not a big deal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well that sounds good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well let me check downstairs again I gotta take some measurements on that room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well now you get
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you've got the logistics of every
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Oh: wait.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And then I think my wife.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: ⌊ Now you
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: now you say about ⌋
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: my wife said she would like to have a register put in this room.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And I think it's kinda weird but what do you think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Why would she
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What is this
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: what is this room used for.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well eventually this is gonna be uh: and we're gonna open this up.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: We're gonna take out some of these shelves and get some light to come through here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: This is sort of like a pantry?
in,TRUE,FALSE,LARR: But kinda pantry area.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: But it's gonna be an extension of the kitchen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Kind of.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So I don't know if ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'd
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah I'd put
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I'd probably put one like right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: About right there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You gonna be putting anything there?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I think
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Probably something's gonna go there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: A % laugh table or something?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause that's about the only spot you can put it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well I mean y- we could put a
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: we could put a floor r- floor register right along here I don't know if you'd want that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But that's probably where I'd put it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: In fact the one that I was gonna put in there I'd probably
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We might have trouble getting to this spot though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: You think so?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cause it starts getting real tight up there on this end.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well let's uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Maybe on this end?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It would have to be: if anywhere it'd have to be down.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: X that's not a bad spot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It's gonna help out cause I
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: See this whole area you've just got that one grill.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: It's a pretty sized area right here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What about the kitchen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well let's
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: let's consider that
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Kitchen's got one?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: kitchen's got one right here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: and uh I'm not too worried about the kitchen.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I don't like hot kitchens anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Cause I mean y
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you got a stove going and
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Ah we're in good shape that way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: ah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Wait a minute.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Did I forget something else too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Ah: yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: We're gonna have to put a register out here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Because y- this this wall is eventually gonna come out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And so: uh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Utility room.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: utility room but it's gonna eventually be part of the kitchen.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: And we're moving the utility room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: So: and this:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: T- % laugh
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: This is a joke.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: N_look at this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Well some of these.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: X Maybe maybe this doesn't make any sense to
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: well some of these things you may wanna wait until you do the remodel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Like
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: I'm th- I'm I'm wa- I'm beginning to wonder if
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Because what I would prob
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: What you can do uh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: is tap right off the plenum.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Cause the furnace is somewhere in that general area.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: It's right there yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: And you can just tap right off the plenum with a duct and bring it to this room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Well that's what we wan⌈ted to
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So that can be done.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: that's what we wanna ⌉ kn- wanna know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: that can be done at a later time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: But maybe t
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: That can be done at ⌈ at any time.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: maybe for the sake of your quotation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Really ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: you should say this is what it's gonna cost you to put in a duct here all these ducts at this time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Now I don't know if
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: if we can price em out individually or not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Sure.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: I call this what utility r- utility room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Just pu- uh call it a
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: figure a duct somewhere on this wall you think?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Let's just assume it'd be on this wall.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Utility room kitchen that back one we'll call that pantry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Pantry and then you got the dining room glass.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: dining room.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: glass dining room.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: and then the parlor.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: and then the parlor one on each end there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: Cause we can do em now or we can do em later.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: But it's not any more difficult to do em at a later time.
in,FALSE,FALSE,SETH: So it's not like you ha:ve to do it now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LARR: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SETH: So the registers that we're connecting to that are existing how many of those we have got.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SETH: We've got the one in the kitchen and then we've got: uh one in the d- living room here.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LARR: That guy then there's one in the bathroom there's one in the s: study and there is one in the library.
