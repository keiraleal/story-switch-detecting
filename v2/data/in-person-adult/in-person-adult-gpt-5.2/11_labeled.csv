out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SAM: He's off today.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: And uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Well.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SAM: but he hasn't had day hours he's been working evening hours and weekends.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANGE: you know I think I'd hate to be in business right now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Oo:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: You can't sit still.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: m.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: You have to expand or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANGE: to keep in the main stream.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SAM: Well and so many times when they expand they've expanded and then things dropped back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,SAM: But this Wallmart needs: ʔuh needs a larger building.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,SAM: It's: just too cramped.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: Your shirt and beads: are most becoming.

out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: for summer.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: A little girl the other day remarked about them and almost on impulse but I didn't do it.

out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: You know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: But then I thought these are the only summer beads I ha:ve.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: And I like

out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: This
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: What did you
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: this
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANGE: See where I sewed right down the middle of that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Otherwise it would balloo:n out?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: And so I s- put it on the machine and sewed right down through the middle of it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,SAM: So it doesn't gap.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: So it d- doesn't gap- % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Oh smart.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANGE: Well it works.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Smart.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: It had a it had a one of tho:se bottoms that

in,FALSE,TRUE,SAM: I don't like those.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: I don't either.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: Makes your butt look thin.

in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: I went over to a store where it says.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: uh: sewing alterations.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And all that stuff.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And I said how much do you charge for taking that bottom band off the top you know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And just making it a straight shirt.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And she said eight dollars.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And I thought oh my lord I didn't pay that much for the top I've got on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: You know that's a little like these catalog things.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DORI: I saw something in a cat

in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: One for Sam and one for me.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: A:nd I looked at the postage attached to it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,DORI: and I thought good heavens.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: It would have been around eight dollar-.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DORI: It's by amounts of money.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Not weight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: It's by money.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: How much m:oney this costs.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: And it's geared according to that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: And I thought ʔuh forget it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: I could take that eight dollars and buy another whole outfit.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: Yeah you know this is amazing.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ANGE: Uh: I like to get: um pillow covers.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: That you zip on to protect the pillows?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ANGE: And uh I went over to Sears one time and or:dered three.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: Through the catalog?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And instead of sending it in with a shipment or anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: I paid postage on it separate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: And do you know the postage came to more

out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: That they're g:earing this in the wrong way.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DORI: It should be geared according to weight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: Now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DORI: That g- cotton
in,TRUE,FALSE,DORI: two pairs of cotton pajamas and that cotton muumuu ain't gonna weigh up to eight dollars worth Believe you me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ANGE: I wouldn't think No.
