out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: or from the barn yet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Good morning this is Doctor Naretto at the Kingman Vet Service?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: X X X X.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: I saw Tad this morning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Um: He's looking not too ba:d Um: A little bit of pain in his abdomen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: It's hard to know if he just has a gastritis: or gastroenteritis from chewing on that dead pigeon or what the problem is.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LIND: Um what we ended up doing was giving him some antibiotics: and sending him home: um If he does not improve we may need to take some rays and he's got some bone:s or something in there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LIND: I didn't feel anything in his belly but yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LIND: A lot of times if they get into garbage or dead things they'll just get an upset stomach and um also a little bit of uh ʔuh well just inflamation in- in there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: and and just feel bad.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: So um I You know Since he's not vomiting now you can go ahead and feed him and stuff and see: how he does Um hopefully the antibiotics will calm down any any infection that he h- that he might have gotten from all the bacteria on the dead pigeon.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: um but if he if he doesn't get better: or if he gets worse: be sure and let us know:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: well but
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Already by tomorrow he should be feeling a lot better.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Um and if he if he isn't or if he starts vomiting or having diarrhea we may need to see him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: we
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: we w- will need to see him again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: um Okay:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mhm you're welcome mm bye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Sh- uh what did you what on your sheet what was the cost for the cast that you charged about what do we generally.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: I think it was like fifty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: With the cast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: to put it on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: To actually put the cast on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Casting materials and then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: And then um She had
in,FALSE,TRUE,LIND: pretty much when we rechecked her she was ready to take it off.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LIND: So we didn't have to do any more rays or anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LIND: I'm trying to remember I think like with the white.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: You got
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I thought you rayed it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: You rayed it with the cast on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: xxx Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: yeah yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LIND: and it was ready to come off and we took it off.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LIND: She did a real good job of keeping it
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LIND: keeping it clean and dry.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: That's I think half the battle.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LIND: cause she didn't have any sores or anything when we took it off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Mm yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Kristen for the for the tranquilizer what do we what is it again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ten.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Ten.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I wonder if she would need more.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: and it'll be:
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Oh he'll yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: For a casting.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: to do a cast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: X xxx Biotal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: if you just biotal and Metofane.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: We ⌈ just.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: or even
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: we'll put ⌉ him on the machine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then you don't have to worry about em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: What was what would that
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: that would be thirteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Total?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: or thirteen extra.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: plus thir⌋teen for anesthesia.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: to put this cast on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause if you don't then y
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: they're waking up and you just.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: It's ba:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: end up spending more time than if you just put em on the silly machine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yep.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: As we know from the sheep.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well and from other things too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Just
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Are those good?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Do you like em?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Did you make em?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I made em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ah
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: I was thinking they were more like a chocolate chip cookie bar.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And then as I got through the recipe I noticed that they don't have any flour in em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: They're good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: So they're actually more like granola bars than
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: They must have
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,"""KRIS: +, cookie bars . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: They've got brown sugar and butter and
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Tastes like they have peanut butter.
in,FALSE,FALSE,"""KRIS: +, ⌊ oatmeal ⌋ (..) and peanut butter chips . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: chocolate chips.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay so a recheck would be about that much with the
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,"""MARC: +, X-rays and then &=ex (..) &{l=WH X X &}l=WH (..) Does that sound right ? ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: two I: think ʔuh if we
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: she woke up we could w- send her home tonight I wouldn't see why we couldn't send her home tonight would you?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: If she wakes up fine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Oh well we're ⌈ gonna be Biotaling her and oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ Sh- if sh
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: she probably won't though ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: never mind ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Never mind.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I was thinking I'm still thinking
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Na.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Na na na And she won't have any an- ʔuh antibiotics Cause using all X X.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: And that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: What is this?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Ten for anesthesia.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: But.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: they're still opposite.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: they're opposite.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah That looks all right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Don't you think we should charge them an extra eightee:n?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: For the distemper vaccine?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Trent does it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: No?
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: I felt horrible doing that on that eye dog that he had in here last week under whatever night it was.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: Cause he had down.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: five plus eighteen and what can you do when he's already got it down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: jeez.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Well Well all we did
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I can't do that cause all we did was I was in here and put a bandage on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Um did you get hold of Dan?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: then?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: He's
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: XX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Let's see.

out,FALSE,FALSE,TREN: Six⌈:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ Let me see.
out,FALSE,FALSE,TREN: six: ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Let me see we need ⌋ one of these and one of these one of those and one of those and two of those.

out,FALSE,FALSE,TREN: Three:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Sent home with Amoxi.
out,FALSE,FALSE,TREN: X three.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: and Pred So We'll se how
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Well ⌋ I'll call him probably late this afternoon to make sure he's all right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: X xxx X X.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: xxx there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: No I was just trying to figure out what % laugh we spent already.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Let' see XXXXXX We've already spent fifty for him and I want him to spend another hundred.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: But that's better than pins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: ⌈ Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And surgery.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Which would ⌋ be another two hundred or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: It's more for a surgery.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: to spend.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Any
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: pretty much any time you can
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And that one really you know I don't think it would benefit from pins.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: m.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: because we'd have to undo it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I mean we'd have to Well we'd have to go we could
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: we could try it closed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: But still it's more expensive.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: I think it'll do fine with a cast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: especially since it's a spiral fracture.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And it's not displaced.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: And it's not displaced.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: should be pretty stable.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: It'll be kind of a pain getting the
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: well maybe not getting the cast over the stifle?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Maybe not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Well as long as she's
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Got kinda long legs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: As long as she's quiet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I'll give him a call.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I don't know if he's in the barn from home.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: In back in from the barn yet or not.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: XXXXXXXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: X called both the house number and the barn number and both of em and a little kid answered.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah and they're little little kids too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: xxx XXXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: They're like xxx xxx on three:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Yeah Carol?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: It's Marcia.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Hi:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: um: we got rays done already and I was gonna let you know what what was going on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Should I talk to Richard?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: or you okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Um: It looks like she's got a spiral fracture Of um of her tibia which is the bone between the knee and the hock a:nd u:m It's f
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: it's really looks pretty stable.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: It's not displaced very far ʔuh anyway and it's um pretty much you know locked in place so to speak um so I think that she would she would do fine with a cast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: U:m a:nd I pretty much got an estimate so far: with the: coming in yesterday and the rays and everything the bill was about four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And to do a cast um: with the anaesthesia and staying one more night in the hospital and stuff and then the casting material probably the
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: ʔuh It's gonna be about a hundred and three total.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: A:nd the only then it would be: the only extra would be in about six to eight weeks we'd have her come in again we would tranquilize her and take the rays and see if it's h:ealed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Enough to take off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And that's generally about four to forty somewhere in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: You know a pin you know if we did a pin it's probably it would probably be even a hundred more.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: but so it's it's That's about the
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: at this point the the least expensive alternative that probably will work for her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Um So If you want to let him know and then have him call me back if you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Lindsey?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: If you wanna go ahead and do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You wanna put this kitty castration down?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: And if she
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: you know if we did it she could probably go home tomorrow.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay whenever whenever you get a chance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Okay thanks Carol.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Mhm byebye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Gee this is the one that was too young and went back home.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: X X X?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: She's
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: she's gonna: talk to him and get back to me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: I imagine they might.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Oh you've grow:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: He gets it just right he's just getting his adult xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: What a cuty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Oh you're beautiful.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: XXXXXX Pretty unusual with that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: XXXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Hey beautiful?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: XXXXXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Oh: you're beautiful.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: xxx X:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Oh: Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: XXX.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: That's what it sounds like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: It kind of sounds like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Sounds like it with the ticking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Is that the needle?
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Kingman Vet Center Heidi speaking.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah::.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAT: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: xxx it hurt.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: You felt the needle.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: aw:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: X X?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Okay is this a dog we've seen before?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Gonna call back?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: ⌈ I talked to Carol.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Okay how old is it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: and she's ⌉ gonna talk to Richard and
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Okay just a moment.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: xxx I'll let you talk to one of the vets.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: I imagine they might go for it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: It's about the cheapest alternative in the world.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Jeremiah Hassel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You stay right here with me:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: is on the phone.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: What.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: And they've got a dog in about three weeks and she was dripping some blood Saturday night.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: He's wondering what it may be: and They wa
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Mmm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: They must have got a replacement for Faith already.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Who's that that called?
out,FALSE,FALSE,HEID: Jeremiah Hassel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Hassel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: You stay here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I'l l be right ba:ck.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Could it be aborting?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Yeah could be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Who's aborting?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARC: Jeremiah Hassel's they got a dog that's pregnant and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Jee:z.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: I heard them.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: due in three weeks and their dog's dripping blood and they're wondering why.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: I heard and I thought it was him.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: he didn't give his name: but I heard a kid o:n p- whatever that shopping thing is on the radio.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Prime Mover?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Prime mover.
in,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: On Saturday morning.
in,FALSE,TRUE,KRIS: Saying that they had a few puppies left that they were gonna sell and then they're taking orders for Christmas puppies.
in,TRUE,FALSE,KRIS: And I thought that's probably who that was.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Last week or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: x.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARC: Guess they gotta make money somehow huh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LIND: Oh Saturday night.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KRIS: Want one of these?
