out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Hey man.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Hey.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Good to see you we:ll I see you went ahead with your plans to do a little skiing there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I did.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SALL: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: We:ll I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself too bad.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Me too.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: and she says you're getting better already.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: so that's always a good sign.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: Yeah I mean I couldn't
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: I couldn't begin to deal with the slightest pressure.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: Yeah give it easy easy yeah don't
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: That still hurts back here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Well you don't want to stretch see what happened you st
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Ch
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: According to this other guy you stretched your ligaments in there and the ligaments are the things that hold your joint together keep it from flopping around so if they get you know stretched just a little when they try to peel down and tighten up and you don't want to you know get em too la:x while they're trying to tighten.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know you want to let em heal as strong as they can.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I mean you can move it I'm not saying you got to go around with it just totally but you don't wanna stretch those ligaments very much when while they're healing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Just
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Just gra:dually bring it around.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Are you using any kind of walking aids.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Nope.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Just walking around.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Hunh?
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah I had for the first two days I had a crutch or two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I switched from two to one like a cane and then I.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Uh: it was really icy there so I it had a spike on it so: I
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Oh that was neat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Peg it in the ground % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: If you forget and walk inside with your spike I guess you're not too well appreciated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: No: % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Bet you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: No % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Let me set you up there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Is it okay if I record this I
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I already have
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It's for a project.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Cool.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Alright what are you doing over there.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I thought you were doing something different.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I thought you were working with languages in
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: Oklahoma?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Hunh?
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: Or in California.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I mean well yeah y- California your basic project.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I wa:s in linguistics.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: That's what this project's for.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah that's
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: but I did a year of it an:d decided it wasn't quite what I really l
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Quite quite what you want okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah it was an unfortunate cause I really don't know quite what I want % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: We:ll that's alright.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: I mean there's a_lot_of things out there you'll find something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I hope so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know ʔuh
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: I move to Oklahoma.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: X
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Completely.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: My son is still flopping around he
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: He uh graduated from medical school this year and uh I mean he's in uh Soho in New York.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Really.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: Starting an art career.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: So: % laugh so you see I mean a_lot_of people you know I mean he's gonna paint for a year and just see whether he can do well enough with that to
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Cause he doesn't want to be a doctor after all?
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: Well he couldn't find anything he really wanted to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know I mean he.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Did he specialize at all?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: he
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: Well that's what I mean no he hasn't specialized yet.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: But he couldn't find anything that just really pulled him toward it a:nd so he said well you know I guess he got a lot out of always doing art when he was young and he's gotta scratch that little itch I ⌈ think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Good for him.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: a:nd ⌉ so he's up there and he'll give it a year and see what happens.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: And the same for you you got
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: You got plenty of
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: There's: uh fortunately this day and time I think it allows ʔuh one to proceed like you're and- you're proceeding and he's proceeding.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: And I think it I think it's the right thing to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I would've d
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I would probably do the same thing were I you know another generation down the line.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know although I r- ʔuh I didn't make the wrong decision for me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But I'm sure I would have been a lot more.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: Uh uh I guess diligent in in working it out beforehand but in in my time you know you really kinda just
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: There wasn't too many things to do you know and you- too many opportunities and so you just kinda chose between a few and that was it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: So % laugh a little simpler lifesty:le in those days.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Tell me where it hurts.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: Uh still a little bit back here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: kay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: Doesn't feel quite normal back there under
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: It originally hurt
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: On the si:des yeah the sides don't hurt mu:ch?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It would
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: Not anymore.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I think it did at fir
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: kay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: at first.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: great.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: He drew some blood out from here the first time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah I saw that.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: You got ʔa little bit of blood not too much that's a good sign too.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Cause usually when they're torn bad they have a lot more blood than that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Is that doing anything.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Nothing bad really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Which one hurts more ba:ck or forward.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: They're about the same.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: About the same.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: There's just this sense of constantly not being quite right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: kay?
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: Well see let me show you something over here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Watch this one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: See I'm pushing ba:ck now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: and I'm pulling forward and it
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You get a little bit of pull coming forward it it moves out a little bit and but when you go back it kinda tight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It's got a good catch to it you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: over here we're gonna pull pull it out.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Wow it doesn't have that same movement.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It's got a little more forward movement and it kinda has a kind of a rubbery kinda end stop there so: uh chances are you've uh hurt that uh ligament in the back too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: The crossband?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: M:hm yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: The
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Call
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: We call em the cruciate ligaments.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: He calls em the ban:ds or whatever they ⌈ are.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah I don't know what
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: th- they ⌉
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: They cross and one
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: They cross because one's going forward and one's going backwards and they keep you from going forwards and backwards is basically what they do so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Hunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Pretty logical arrangement there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah it is.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Your posterior's messed up a little bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Well can that get better?
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: U:h mm: get a little better maybe.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It's not gonna get all the way right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It'll be a little bit of a problem.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I'm not sure you didn't maybe have some of that before I don't really know uh let me see w- how much this hurts here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: None?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: My main physical activity for the past year and a half has been aikido.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: which is a pretty gentle art.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: kay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Lot of rolling lot of
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: The knees do take something from that I believe that they
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: A lot of work on em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Sure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Any of those things gotta put some kinda stress on your leg you know?
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I definitely want to get back to it though.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I had to lay off it for a while.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: That hurts right over here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SALL: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: kay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It's not too bad though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,SALL: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: It's just ve:ry mi:ld uh that
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: That one could probably
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: See look at the difference on here now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: what- see
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: See how much of a jiggle you got there you got just a little laxity there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: righ:t?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And this one's just a hai:r different.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I mean it
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But it hurts.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: A bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh a little bit.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It hurt a lot at first.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But it's just a hair and uh so if you just let that one kinda heal you know which I think it's gonna do cause you don't even complain much of this over here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know when you're doing things you're thinking more about this back one and that's the posterior band if you want to put it like that or posterior cruciate we call it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh seems to be the problem but it's not uh I'm not sure you didn't have a little bit of that problem before.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It isn't
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: All these years since the wreck the the leg's never felt you know like it it's never been totally normal but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I just got used to it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Did your knee did your knee feel like it would
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Sorr- that hurts a bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: X Where did that get you over here?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Again yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: That's okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Did your knee feel like it had some play in it you know it wasn't real steady.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I don't remember.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: That being a
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Being a complaint while you were doing your martial arts stuff?
out,FALSE,FALSE,SALL: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Still hurt a little bit too.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I injured the front of the knees when I was dancing for a while I was dancing with Kristy Hannah here few years ago and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: there were some times I came down on it and it did some
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: XXXXX?
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: But that was impact injury.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Let's see how rough that is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Let your knee down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Alright now straighten your knee out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah you've got a little
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Put your
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Put your hand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You feel it?
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah it's X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But that's pretty typical.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: How about this one.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You got anything over ⌈ here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I've got a X.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: no that's ⌉ pretty slick.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Just a little click over there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Alright?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh hold your leg real strong there let me pull on it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And let's see if we got a pretty good muscle there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Is that hurting anything?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Kay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Alright well I
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I think uhm You know I
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I think probably it's mostly posterior cruciate not so much anterior cruciate which is good um the medial collateral ligament that l:igament here is just minimally hurt uh I think so:me of that posterior cruciate was probably already r- there and the reason I'm saying that is because it really doesn't hurt that much when I pull on it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: See the
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: This is the one that pulls on that
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It feels tight though a bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: When I push back I'm pushing on it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: That's
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And and that's not bothering you very much.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But see this one has been hurt and when I pull on this one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: That does hurt.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: y- it it hurts.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: So I mean you know I mean pretty simple you know if if they've been hurt they gonna hurt when you stretch em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: you know so that's why I'm thinking that posterior is probably a_lot_of that's been there you may have hurt it a little bit more you know and yʔ
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: So you got this one a little bit and this one a little bit Both of em are a little both of em can probably heal up if you let em a:nd.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: No need for surgery to make it better?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: No.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: unh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And uh the: the outcome will probably be: pretty close to what you had before.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: In other words I
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I may have lost a b:it but it's: not
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: I mean you know five percent or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know what I mean you know I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know you'll just have to
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Try to have to see how it plays out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But it it's gonna be minimal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And you can z
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: You can overcome that a little bit by getting your muscle in better shape.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: There are two things that stabilize your knee.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: This is your knee brace the big muscle above your knee is the brace for your knee that's what holds it together when you're doing things.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: In fact you know all the sports players they
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Their ligaments have been stretched so much and repaired and stretched and repaired that they
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: They're just not much good and they really have to compensate with their muscle power ⌈ is what they do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: They do a_lot_of leg lifts?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: S⌉o right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh: you know just just uh you can do straight leg lifts or what we call just those little short extensions just put a bolster under behind your leg right here extend the last twenty to thirty degrees with weight on your leg like this do little short extensions with weight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mhm?
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: and keep working up on the weight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Mhm?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: you wanna b
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: What you wanna do and you can just do isometrics you can just l:ock your knee real stiff and just tighten your muscle hold it tight as you can for three seconds and then let it rest for three seconds and then tight for three seconds and then rest.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And you don't have to move it when you do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Uh ʔuh: all kinda ways.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: So just whatever the day will al- permit I mean if you're sitting around and you got some time to do some isometrics you can do that and then when you have other time you can do the weights.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: But keeping this strong will compensate for your ligaments is the plan.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know so uh you know I think I think you'll find you you do pretty well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Do you think I can go back to aikido and stuff?
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Probably as long as it's not too too violent.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know it's more form and shape and stuff or it's it's not too much contact.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It's about
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: But no it's ideally it's about blending.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It's about blending with the attack it's not about meeting the force with force so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: There's a_lot_of rolls.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay mm well I guess if you got good at at doing it you know where you didn't
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Wasn't getting yourself in awkward positions ʔand you know getting your knee all twisted up underneath you or something you know you could probably handle it okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I think I think you'll you'll be able to see for yourself.
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Because once you get your muscles strong you get this thing controlling your knee well you'll see what kind of knee control you have it'll be pretty obvious to you whether you you have the type of control to do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: What do you think the lesson should be from this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I mean ʔuh
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: This is the first time I've ever been on skis.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: I never did it before my wreck so I guess the less
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: W- one lesson is I'll probably shouldn't try skiing anymore.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: ʔI ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: ʔHe
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know if it were me personally that would probably be the lesson I'd learn from it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Cause I'm lucky it wasn't worse.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: When I
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It was a pretty bad fall.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: the
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: The incline was about I don't know what grade but there was a turn in the wood
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: It was this was in the woods.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: And it was cross country.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: So I didn't know what I was doing my girlfriend had taught me I had been skiing for two and a half hours I was tired.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: and we were getting close to getting back and I got ʔuh carried away.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: She showed me how when you're
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: In cross country when you're about to fall you just sit down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: But I didn't do it right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: So there was a turn and then I
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: And the skis don't snap off of course.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: ⌊ Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I ⌋ know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: And so it stuck and I kept twisting.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: and the knee took all the torque.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: ʔOh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: And I didn't know what I'd done.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I screamed and she helped me and I manage to somehow I don't know ʔuh
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: S- somehow managed to get up and hobble on the ski pole all the way ⌈ back to the cabin.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Oh my God.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: and then we had to ⌉ call the uh s- the ambulance to take us sixty kilometers to Oreille which is a ski resort.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Geez.
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: We were in the middle of nowhere.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Hunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I'm a little
in,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: ʔI I think it's been three weeks now I
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I was hoping that you know you told me or doctor Smith told me that you know with chronic osteo it could come back from impact and I was
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: And I really hope this is not the time you know I've made it how many
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Ah that's unlikely.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I've
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I have not spiked any fever or or seen any signs of.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: No: it's it looks pretty good.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I think I may have gotten lucky.
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: Yeah if it's not hurting up there the pain would be probably your first warning sign.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: If that ever happened.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You could start feeling some cha:nge in the the status quo you know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Changes.
in,FALSE,TRUE,DARR: I still feel
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,DARR: It feels b:- pretty much like the other leg.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: That's great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Wonderful.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Solid.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: Well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Love it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: Well I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself it's a cheap lesson.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: That's right % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,SALL: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,DARR: I'd say so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: Yeah I
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: I was out
in,TRUE,FALSE,REED: We were out and the kids were skiing you know and I was watching em go down and I was thinking God that would sure be fun.
out,FALSE,FALSE,REED: You know?
in,FALSE,FALSE,REED: And then s- just barely my common sense won out and I decided not to do it but you know I've had two discs taken out of my back my neck f:used for a bad disc I don't need to go flumpitybump@o down the hill.
in,FALSE,TRUE,REED: You know I don't need any of that so you just have to have to kind of draw a few lines.
