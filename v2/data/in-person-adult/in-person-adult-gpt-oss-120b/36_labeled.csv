out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: He's teething.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: You should have heard him the night we took him to the emergency room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: He sounded worse.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: I % laugh pr- if- ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: I know I would probably've been totally freaked out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: That's sca:ry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Maybe it's good he didn't stay with me I'd ve been like Michael.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Yeah he was
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Scary.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: He was: um:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: I'd be like Mom uh what should we do with this child.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Well his temperature was a hundred and four point five.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: That is so high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: He's lucky that he didn't
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: How long was he there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: That high.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: How long do you know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Uh his fever?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: That's da:ngerouʔ
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: I mean it's xxx
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: The doctor said.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Cause he could have brain damage:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: The doctor said that th- um his pediatrician cause I asked him about it and he said that they don't hospitalize until they go up to like a hundred and seven.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And that's where it's fatal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And I was like well you know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: What about brain damage.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: That doesn't matter or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: M:m:m:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Excuse me brain damage is important to me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: He said actually f:evers ʔuh:are
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: How did he explain it he said something like fethers : fevers *
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: Fevers are like um good for babies like when they're i- b- getting sick because they help the immune system fight harder.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Somehow.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Well that's what the
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: I don't know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: I mean that's what
in,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: The reason the body gets that hot is like to kill the germs or whatever I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Isn't that part of it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Yes doctor Kevin tell us.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: ⌊ No I'm pretty
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: I'm ⌋ pretty sure I'm pretty sure that's part of it but ʔuh:uh it's just that you have to watch out cause then if it gets too hot it's bad for the brain.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: It's like a car it overheats.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: I know the one in the lower right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Which one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: This one is mine.

out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Sometimes some of the things he says.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Does he talk big long things but you just can't understand em?

out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Don't freak out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Are you okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Cause I tickled his feet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: It's all my fault.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Give him a drink.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: It's he drinks too fast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: It just went down the wrong pipe.

in,TRUE,FALSE,LISA: Probably he was ʔuh opening

in,TRUE,FALSE,LISA: Breathing through his mouth more cause he couldn't breathe through his nose at
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Mm:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: And then he couldn't even breathe he had um they had this thing it was this big old long old tube.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Here.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: and it was funny cause like we could
out,FALSE,FALSE,BABY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: They put a mist.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LISA: Child you're having problems.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: And you could just see like smoke you know like a mist like a humidifier coming out and I was like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: and I was all
in,FALSE,TRUE,KEVI: Out of his throat I mean then where'd they put this on in where did it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: No they stuck it in a tu
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: It came out of a tube and I just had to hold it like around his face:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Oh: oh okay okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: so that he could
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Come here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: It was oxygen but they put a mist in it so that he could
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: They didn't want to stick ʔuh oxygen tube up his nose or put a mask on him cause he'd take it off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: And it was funny because every time like he'd see a person wearing blue: he'd be all and he'd start like not breathing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Oh:: % laugh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: and then he'd like ⌊ poor % laugh
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: And then it ⌋ would sto
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: And they'd be all okay okay and they'd walk out of the room cause they didn't want to excite him cause they didn't want him to hyperventilate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Poor thi:ng.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: XXX:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Yeah he's doing better.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And then the doctor comes in and he just looks at him and then they stick this fing
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: thing on his finger?
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: It's like light sensored?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: And they have to guard it from the light and that's what measures his heart rate?
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And it measures his oxygen percent how much oxygen he's getting.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Wild.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Cool?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: It was weird.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And he was all in
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Did his oxygen get low?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Or:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Yeah it was like six percent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Yeah?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Which
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Of what's:
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Supposed to be like ninety what?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: A hundred.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: U:m adults are probably
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Like seven's okay I think.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Adults are supposed to be anywhere from like three to on up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: X You gonna go down?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: But anything
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: ⌊ And you ha
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Ba⌋bies higher or lower.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Gonna go on the floo:r?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: babies are usually higher because you know ⌈ they ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Are you mad at Nina:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: They haven't been around as lo⌉:ng % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: So she
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Yeah so: he was really not doing well.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: No:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Nobody should really be that low.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: I mean people that are that low there's they have asthma and stuff like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Hee hee h- hee hee.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: They like
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Or emphysema.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: ʔuh Ha ha ha ha.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: But he was
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And his heart
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: What was his heart rate?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Two o four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: And it's supposed to be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: I think he said like o:ne eight or something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Well babies are supposed to have really high heart rates.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: But one eight versus two o four?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: That's still scary.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: And he'd just do ʔuh he was doing ʔit when he'd get really excited so that's why they were staying away from him.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: And uh we had to hold him down for them to give him a shot in his thigh:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: A shot: why'd they give him a shot.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: To make the swelling go down in his throat.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: Oh: did he get it in his bottom?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: N:o right here in his thigh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: How is he about shots.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: That's good.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: the next time I took him he's all I was all oh my Go:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: And then I picked him up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: xxx.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARI: and his legs were bleeding and stuff and I had blood all on my shirt and I was all oh my Go:d % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Blood- ʔuh
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARI: Blood cause he bleeds.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: After they give him a shot?
out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: But don't they like put a thing on it right after?

out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: No but it was just coming out.

out,FALSE,FALSE,KEVI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: That doesn't make sense to me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: Why sh:
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Because when they just leave it in their mouth the juice just

out,FALSE,FALSE,LISA: They just gur
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARI: Yeah and in a cup they you know they.
