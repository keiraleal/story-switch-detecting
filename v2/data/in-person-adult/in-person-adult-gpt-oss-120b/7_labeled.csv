in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: God I said I wasn't gonna do this anymore.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Stay up late.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Kinda defeats the purpose of getting up in the morning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And it's a hard habit to break:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Usually I don't
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: It i:s.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: s- ʔuh Usually I don't stay up late.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: But it's like if I'm up after midnight?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: It's just like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Hm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: What can I do now.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I still can't ʔuh
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: God I still can't believe Tim bitching around and he lied too.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: He said that he talked to Ron and all this other shit?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: About what.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: About ʔuh the way they were feeling of them being the only ones cleaning the house and all this other shit?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: I mean what they don't realize is like shit when Ron gets home from wor:k I wanna spend time with Ro:n because Ron usually doesn't get home till nine % laugh or ten.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Unlike Tim he has to w:ork for every little dime that he makes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: He doesn't get any breaks.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeahʔ Tim is on salary: and he can take lea:ve and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm and he earns lea:ve.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: he's
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: he gets sick leave we don't get shit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I don't know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: It is really hard living with another couple.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I mean we
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: If we set our
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: If we sit down and set some rules which we never did ʔuh ʔuh ʔit could work.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: what it amounts to is mutual r- respect and l- like Tim told Ro:n he: told him he goes um what was it he goes nobody fucks with my lifestyle.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: I % laugh feel the exact same way.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And all those bitches and complaints that he has they're about my lifestyle.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mhm:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And he doesn't realize that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And that's what I'm gonna tell him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: We:ll ʔuh: you know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And the only way it's gonna work is if we have respect for one another.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: That's right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: That's right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And it doesn't mean going to our parents and complaining about one another I'm gonna tell him if you have any complaints you talk to the person that you have the complaint about.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I'm also going to suggest weekly house meetings to discuss such things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: You know what it would be a real good lesson for them too in self assertiveness.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yep.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: you know and especially the way um I mean Tim gets in- himself into a: uncomfortable situation or whatever and his first reaction is to blow up about it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: You know cause he let
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: he lets it pile up.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yep.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: He doesn't do nothing positive about it and then he just blows up.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And if something bothers you you go and you I was like last year I was really proud of myself when I was asked to take over intermediate algebra?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And teach it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And I di:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And I also went.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: and I asked for a raise instead of
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: cause instead of just sitting in the class and getting five dollars an hour I was now gonna be up there teaching it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: and instead of getting the five dollars an hour % laugh I ended up getting fifteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: But I went and I asked.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Now if i
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: You know if you put a situation like that to Tim or Mandy cause not because they're they're weak in character or anything but because they're
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: They're babies.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: They hem and haw around and somebody else would have to talk for them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: You know?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I don't know.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And it's Right now uh I don't know if I should mention it to him or what but I'm feeling like he's taking me for granted.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yep.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And he's rolling in it Mary.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And you know what the sad thing the thing that really scares me?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: is that they're n:
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: th- at the rate they're going and with all the breaks that they've gotten they're never gonna have hard times.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Hard times do train you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yep.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: They do.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Like I came over here to work with Danae which is what I'm going to do I'm going to do some translations for her and stuff?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: tonight?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: A:nd um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: you know I have to make at least f:ifty dollars or so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: to make it worth my time but like tonight well I called you know this thing was going on with Buck and everything so I called um Mandy's or I called our house and Mandy answered the phone and I said where's
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: you know where's
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: where
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Is Ron there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And she said no.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: When we were on our way to Tim's game he was at Town Pump and he asked what time we'd be home and we said probably about nine.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And she said then we went over to your grandma's but then we came back and he wasn't here yet.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So: I called the Town Pump and asked if he was still in the casino course he wasn't he was on his way home.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And I said tell
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: So I called Mandy back and I told her to have him call me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: when he got home.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: So: I was in the bathtub when he called and I talked to him for a while and he went and he was really down about what what I told h:im that Tim had said to me and how I was so upset?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: He goes why didn't you tell him to go and wake me up.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I said I di:d and he wouldn't do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: He goes they w
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: they were sitting around getting all fucked up he said but he said I went right to bed he said I didn't get done working until after nine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh ma:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Cause that car pile up they had between Hardin and Crow?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh: shit really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I didn't hear about it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Ron was s:inglehandedly there.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: with one wrecker.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: G- yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: Seems like any time I've seen a wrecker out here there's always two guys in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: m X everyone % laugh was gone when the call came in.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And Jay's not supposed to go on those anymore because of his heart so he had to send Ron by himself and Ron was s:lowly pulling everybody out of the ditch.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Did they all hit each other?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Or just.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Kind of.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Aʔ- aʔ semi bumped a car and then went and went on two wheels and just about lost it and then got back up on all all its wheels again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: Did it land in the ditch?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: But it
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Kind of it was able to get out but all the other cars that were in the direct vicinity all hit the ditch.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And then there was three cars and the semi.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And then this uh this guy pulled up and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: he was going to uh Peggy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: you remember Peggy White?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Her husband Gary Bighare?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mhm?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: Him and her pulled up and they were in the van?
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And they stopped to ask Ron what happened?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: And here another car came and rear em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh::.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And they ended up having to take um: Peggy White by helicopter to Billings.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Man that's pretty ba:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I know.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: Darn this darn dog keeps breathing and like dreaming you know I wonder if we should wake her up?
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: No she'll get scared and want to go outside.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Kinda nervous you know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: They say you can really mess up a dog by waking em up when they're dreaming.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: It's so cold outside but yet sometimes she insists on staying out there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I know:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: You know what I was thinking of doing?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Hunh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I don't know she's kind of shy but I was wondering.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: what it would be like to train her.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: to pull a sled.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: I don't know if she'd do it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I don't know if she would either.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: She's kind of timid.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: She doesn't trust too many people at all.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Oh and you know another thing that Tim had the audacity to bitch about?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: What.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: He said um Mandy had to stay up all by herself and decorate the tree.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: until four in the morning.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And I even asked if we could put our ornaments on there and they told me that there wouldn't be enough room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm Tim said that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: She was probably lonely when she was doing it you know that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: She probably was.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: X
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I sat up with her and I was talking to her she was doing all the decorating I mean what was I gonna do.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: She- I mean she was just putting up the balls and everything and she'd say where where do you think this should go and so I was sitting there doing my Welfare application.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And uh: you % laugh know % laugh I was just sitting there watching her telling her where to put everything and what not.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: Did you know Nickie wanted her own tree:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Ye:s?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And I forgot to bring it in it's outside?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: What are you gonna do with it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: She wants to set it up for her Barbies.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I was just gonna use a tin can and put rocks in the bottom?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And just stick it in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And you know what I did?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Hm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I didn't want to waste a tree's life.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: so I just cut a branch off one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: God I fell up there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Where'd you go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: to get em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: You know where Sarah and Arvela live?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Just around the corner.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Remember that first cattle guard you go over?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I didn't even go over that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: You mean kinda like by the
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: by the tunnel?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Right below the tunnel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Oh:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And I just walked up
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: W:e just walked up around uh that area God Alice that was f:u:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Did you get grandma a tree too?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: unh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Does she already have one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: m.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: That pickup could only hold like three.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I wonder why
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Did daddy say to take the pickup back?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Or what was the deal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Why.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: Cause Phoebe needs it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: What's wrong with the car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh you didn't hear about it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: unh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh you did about how the engine was on fire?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: See there was oil spilling out leaking out from the valve cover.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: The valve cover gasket apparently cracked or whatever and there was oil coming out and the oil got hot and you know how it gets hot and smokes?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Well I guess enough came out because we were losing oil bad going from Billings to Crow um there's a_lot_of
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"""MARY: +, smoke coming out and by the time we got to Hardin we had to put like uh: (..) three or four quarts in . ▶"""
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: It was three.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: An:d by the time we got to
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,"""MARY: +, Crow (..) it was: (..) it was one quart low . ▶"""
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And there was smoke still coming from under the engine I figure w- if it was losing that much oil then it caught fire.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: Cause the engine was hot cause there wasn't enough water in the radiator.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I talked to Oscar about it and he said well I checked it was only it was only about I'd say a half a quart to a quart short of water.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: But that shouldn't make any difference.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: He goes the only thing I can think of is that there was an air lock in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And that running the engine out on the open road?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Caused that air lock to come through.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: flushed it out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: And bust the gasket?
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: No: it would more or less um the engine wasn't being kept cool enough.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Cause there wasn't enough fluid in the radiator.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And you know how the radiator's the pipe's close to other parts of the engine?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: So what
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: It was some part in there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,"""ALIC: +, ⌊ caused the f⌋ire . ▶"""
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: The engine being too hot and the oil leaking.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: So he knew that the oil was leaking?
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: No we knew we were losing oil but we didn't know where.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I just figured it was from: that valve cover gasket.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Just from lifting up the hood and looking at it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: So what's he gonna do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Well ʔand two of his wires the sparkplug wires?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: were fried all the way through.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: So we took those off and we replaced them with some old ones out of the garage.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I knew tha:t.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And it runs.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: It runs.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: There's enough uh: radiator fluid in there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: so that it will It's it's enough.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: But I think running it out on the open road will cause it possibly to shoot more oil out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: That valve cover gasket has to be replaced.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I don't know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: Oh I freaked Cookie and Rita and Gary out tonight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Remember the Plain- Plainfeather uh Claypit?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: where that red clay is?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Right there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I saw my my speedometer just go Brr:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: like that just dow:n.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: You know and I knew exactly what it was.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: What I have to do is take off the distributor wire and splice it in with the fuel pump wire.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: Because my: fuel pump is now electric Never used to be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Hand me that ashtray.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Or your light I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Your light.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: It's behind the sewing machine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And uh: sometimes it gets loose.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And no more fuel.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Unhunh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: So I stopped the car and they said what are you doing.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I said oh I gotta tighten this wire here.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: So I had Cookie turn on the ignition and turn it off.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: So cause see once you turn that key on then you hear theʔ the fuel pump come on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And if the wire's not connected right it doesn't come on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: So I did that and I lit a match to find out where I was and n- after everything was hunky_dory then I shut the hood and got back in and I started up the engine and both Gary and Rita were sitting on the edges of their seat.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: And I turned around and I looked and I said did I scare you kids?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: They wouldn't say anything then Gary goes yeah I was scared.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: But I freaked em out I don't know.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: Then daddy said something about the steering column on my car needing work?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Said long as I don't drive it fast it should be alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: But oh man I don't know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: See the thing about it is if I go after Ken I'm not really gonna have any money.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: to um: you know do things.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: I'm not saying I'm gonna pay for everything but I don't want to be broke: around him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I know that really sucks.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Cause I wanna at least be able to put gas in the car:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: and go do something.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I don't think it's such a good idea for you to go up there in the winter.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Mm:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I've been thinking about that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: We should all get some money together and is there any way he could ⌈ like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: meet us in Great Falls ⌉ or something?
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Cause I'd like to go up there and go to the um Red Lobster?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Cause I've been just cr:aving seafood.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: That's the halfway point he could do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I bet he could do it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: When though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: I don't know:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: He goes back to school like the secon:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: ʔuh Oh shoot.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Well isn't there any way like we
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: that we could just m:eet him up there and maybe
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: What bring him down?
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: Bring him down or I don't wanna take your car.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I was gonna ask you and m:om too if you could um take care of Trace for a couple days next week.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh?
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: What you got in mind.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: I need to get caught up on my work.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: Wednesday I have an appointment at nine thirty.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Mom's off isn't she?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Oh that's righ:t.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: That's right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah I think that'd I think that'd um work out like if she had to go shopping or something maybe you could go with her and help her with him?
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: And Nicky helps her with him alot anyway.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And then of course he adores me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I remember I was pregnant with Nicky.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And uh: Boots's little boy he really liked me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: when I was pregnant with her?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: ʔuh You know how it is when we're pregnant we get real sleepy?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: I'd fall asleep on the couch and he'd lay by me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And he'd fall asleep with me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: And I remember he would
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: I woke up and here he was gone his mother carried him in the other room.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm % laugh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: and God that kind of pissed me off.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Was
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALIC: Would u:m Was Nicky mad when Trace was a boy:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Kind of.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: She thinks I should have twins.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Twin girls.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: But I don't think she'll realize the uh sibling rivalry.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,MARY: But I don't know she's six years old now.
in,TRUE,FALSE,MARY: And they say that if there's six years between children there's not that much rivalry.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: After four there's almost none.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: Cause they're.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Four is ideal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,MARY: they're kind of in different worlds.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: Because see Trace will be the next time I have a baby Trace will probably be: about three?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALIC: four?
