out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔuh: You know it's: it was really pretty straightforward this morning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And y- z
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I thought you did a good job all the way through.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I mean you were on top of what you were scanning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌊ Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Thanks ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: should've kept that one Horizon Fauker jet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: just t- keep em on the right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Why did you switch em.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: Well ʔuh looking at something I would get
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: it didn't seem like I could get someone else out.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: But um a:nd part of it to provide a good service but then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔuh Well ʔuh that- that
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: I guess that's one reason the two eight's kind of
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: well two eight's kinda nice sometimes because ʔuh: ʔuh I mean when we're on ten all the departures seemed like they're going out the left.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: so you really want your arrivals on the right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: When you're landing two eight then you can get departures off of almost both at any time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: So you always got a hole.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: N_yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: So but uh don't feel bad about keeping Horizon on the right boy because.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: sure doesn't hurt them to taxi any.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: They're so used to having A number one service.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: plus ⌋ when they're ⌈ departing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: every one of em came
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: they're right by ⌉ the gate.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Everyone
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: even even one or
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: one or two of em I said I'll advise if the left becomes available.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌈ and they said w-.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ⌊ and they
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: they still ask ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: we'd like the ⌉ left if it becomes available.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I know they still ask.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And Viking is the same way.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: There's: sh:
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: there's sure nothing wrong with keeping em on the right though.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Um Traffic Watch Eight we discussed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: So radar service terminated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: um call me inbound or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: You wanna say radar service terminated frequency change approved.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Report back inbound.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Or I I think that something a littleʔ little more like that's better than just saying radar service terminated because he's kinda
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Left hanging.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: And you could just say radar service terminated report back inbound and then he'll
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: he'll either come back and say well I'm departing the area now back to Hillsborrow Or I'll call you back inbound.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So that gives you an idea.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: But uh a:nd uh ʔuh: Along with that Let TC do more of the work for you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔyou know Um just tell her what you want her to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I was thinking of a couple instances where you could've used her more than you did.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I was thinking that for my rundowns you know that would ʔuh that's
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: that would have been a help but on the other s- the other hand.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BILL: I wanna get it on tape heck of a job Lance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌊ Oh thank you very much.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Did you hear that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: um ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: The problem with doing rundowns is that ⌉ it's kind of over in your face.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Cause the light's kind of pretty far over to the left there but sh- you can you can have her do it if you want.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Um I would
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I'm just working at doing as much of these other things as I possibly can Because they'll be times when I won't have a TC and just
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: just ⌈ challenging myself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ⌊ And that's okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌉ Um what were some of the things other than
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: what- what were some of the things that that I should have used ⌈ her for that I didn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Depending on who your
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌉.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Who your TC is if c- certain people sit down there they d
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: they have a tendency to do everything for you.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: And sometimes that is p
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: that is really pretty nice.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: If you just if you just all you have to do is stand up and look out the window and look at the bright.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: and talk.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: ʔuh: You- no other w
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: no other coordination or or ARTS functions or anything That really is nice.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: That's ideal.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: It it really helps.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: the situation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: So but ʔuh: Right now like you say maybe it is better for you to do some of that stuff.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: um I don't think there was I mean I had just a couple that I switched to the left you know maybe three or so that I switched to the left uh p
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: uh probably two or three and so there was that I didn't have any ARTS entries I had you know Traffic Watch to slew out to.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: For the most part I mean I was able to k
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: I think I was able to keep up with that stuff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: With the ARTS.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: I mean there wasn't really nothing much to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: um.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: No there wasn't.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: So.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: But there could be.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: If there's VFRs departing or.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: I told her to do my VFR guys.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔOh ʔYeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: And um to write down my VFRs.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: That's % laugh one thing I gotta kick myself to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Now are we still required to w
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: write like the Empires that coming in through the gates VFR?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Don't they?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: We are?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Any VFR.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: Now isn't that aren't they when they c
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: But what if they've
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: c- well I guess we have no way of knowing if they've come in IFR and then cancelled VFR.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Well yeah because they have a strip on it downstairs.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔI don't
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔuh: actually ʔuh I'm like you I don't really know what the point is of that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Because we do have a record of em anyway.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: But.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔuh when the
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: when the
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: order came across or whatever or this memorandum that said to write down all VFR arrivals.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So if they're a VFR arrival you're supposed to write it down.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I'll do that then.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Unhunh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: When Horizon eight didn't answer you there?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Go back to ground?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: or just move on to something else.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: I mean you tried him a couple times.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: You say Horizon eight XXXXX if they don't get the hint if he's
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: but if you can't get him just go on.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: and do something else that you can do.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: United was calling ready to go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: So shoot.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: just let United go.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Horizon.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: you can't do nothing with him so just have him hold there.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: So just go on to the next.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Next thing and do tell ground.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: He might be still on ground frequency which is
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: uh usually not too likely because you know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: At that point.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: At that point well he's out there.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: you know He's
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: and he's probably sitting there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: and th- he's not hearing anything from the tower you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: he's probably looking at his radio about then.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: Yeah I think I was a little bit rigid in my planning of that cause I wanted to
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: had to plan to get him out at that point.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: a:nd I should've been more flexible and.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: But uh you know everything else I saw you- your separation was was really good this morning.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I mean you really tightened em up.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Maybe a couple times almost a l:ittle bit ⌈ too tigh:t % laugh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: a little too tight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Cause uh ⌉ ʔuh
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I don't know y- a couple times you had like one just barely at departure end a jet at departure and you cleared another jet for takeoff.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And it worked out great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Oh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: One guy out the right and then
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: oh th
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: both guys out the ⌈ left.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Both guys out to the left.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌉.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: And it worked out good but ʔuh I think it worked out because this guy was real slow on on starting his departure roll.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: usually you gotta get em just a little bit off the departure end.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: before you clear the next guy.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: And watch out for the uh the th:seven hundreds.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: hundreds Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Or three hundreds and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Because uh ʔuh: they'll really climb.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And they can go fast too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: So well you know just take into consideration the type of aircrafts.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: It takes the seven a little b- while to get wound up while the seven'll really go.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: But uh ʔuh
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: I mean it was really good.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Good departure separation.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Thanks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I was impressed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: A:nd you saw: a little bit about the sixty?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Heading?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ʔuh Listen to the readbacks for
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: If I know he's at thirty.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: But you can wrap em around to thirty or sixty to avoid the MBA and that works great because: otherwise you got sixty?
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: There was that one time you had
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: two: south plan aircraft and one westbound
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: or river metro and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I d
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I actually didn't think you were gonna have three miles between the two first.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: south plan air lane but you did.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: That was perfect.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: The one that I kept on runway heading for ⌈ a bit?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: or ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And that was good it was real good planning to keep that one Caravan on runway heading when you had the other one going sixty?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: To ensure that you had oh and you had the one going forty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: or some⌈thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: and then you had the ⌉ Metro going s:
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: going sixty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: But you kept the Metro on this runway heading.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Which is really good planning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I'm
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I'm
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: less and less impacted.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: For lack of a better word.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: by these g
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: for some reason with all these um I think the bulk of my planning seems to revolve around these little guys when I can turn em fitting em in with all my other guys for some reason I mean y- and that is you know those guys having a very fec- effective part in the whole fan of all our departures.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: And um.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I think they're they're a- affecting me less than they did in the past.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Does that make sense?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Do you know what I mean?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Um cause i
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: there was a time where I mean that sequence was good too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: but there was a time when yeah an ʔi
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: it it may happen again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: Who knows
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: where I've got the little West Coasts in here and all these guys off the right and left where am I actually gonna fit these guys in and they're all calling they're ready way early.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: And.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Well the sequence uh can't be too bad.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: When you got
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: when you can feed from charley.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: xxx.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: and from bravo and from alpha.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: You know ʔuh the sequence can't be too bad I mean all he did.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: You got something you can do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: All he did is send em all out.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: I mean you got all the West Coasts in the row over on charley.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: you got the jets in a row on bravo and you got n- various things over here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: So you can pick and choose.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: You know y
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I mean as a ground control you can just send em all out there and then when they get there then you can start arranging the strips.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: You know the way you want almost.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: You know th- that's.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: that it works great.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: That way.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Because you don't have to sequence em at some other point in their taxi route you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: They're b
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: they
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ʔe
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: essentially on their own taxiway up through
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: up to the approach end.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: So.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: So that was about all.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: that I
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: you know that I had.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I mean I was paying pretty close attention there and I didn't really see much of a problem.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Thanks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: N:o significant problems.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: xxx to talk about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: I'm glad.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: See there was S
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Oh um don't always ʔuh: um don't insist on always saying seven hundred.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: If you say
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ⌈ Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Why hadn't you
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: at some ⌉ point after he is leaving seven just wait till he is leaving seven hundred you mean?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Sometimes you can do that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: There was a couple times you didn't need to say it when when you did.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: It was out in the
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Well I mean ⌈ y- w
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: Could've either waited just a bit.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: it was at ⌋
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: He was at a hundred climb and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Or he was a
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: just go ahead and say turn left heading one six zero.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Or turn left heading two six zero.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: For a Metro.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I mean if you leave em on runway heading for a little bit.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: they're gonna be at the altitude you need so but that's no big deal.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: A:nd uh I was watching Jet Speed come in and you got Delta out in front of Jet Speed.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: It seemed like you were a little tense with that but really pay attention to the speeds when they're coming in.
in,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: He was doing a hundred and twenty outside of Laker there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Did you see that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: So that
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: that worked out great.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: I wondered if you'd saw
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: I mean there was lots of room.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Lots of ⌈ time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: He ⌉ wasn't he z- wasn't flying as a normal.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: For some reason he just used the
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Or is it uh Exec Jet.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: One of those guys is usually really fast.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Jet Speed is th- I know fast on the pr- departure.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Flight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: it seems.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: ʔuh I think.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: It seems like that was the one but yeah Flight when they fly the later jet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Um yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: And I think I might have said for delta niners or to no delay or something like that and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: ⌊ Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I think you did ⌋.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: And he was actually floating at
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: ʔuh the Jet Speed wasn't
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah you had a_lot_of time.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: When the Twins get airborne you got a jet following the twin- twin's gonna go southwest bound?
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: If you got thousand feet and the twin's climbing out of four or five hundred you can start your transmission then to the to the jet.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Twin Cesna ahead is: will be turning southwest bound momentarily runway two eight left clear for takeoff.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: It says in sight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Just didn't wanna be sure he gets his turn in?
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: The Caravan's coming across if you wanna get
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Yeah what do you say.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Cause I've heard different phraseology and I af- feel like I was stumbling over that I think I said it- couple different ways.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: A mile west or something
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I'll- I just say ʔuh: you know on a day like this it's so easy to see em I would just say the Caravan ahead is southwest bound.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Runway two eight left clear for takeoff.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: And and they'll a_lot_of times they'll say uh in sight.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: If they don't say in sight they'll say ʔuh: they'll I would assume they have em in sight because they won't go.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Unless they seem em.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: I mean that's important to them to see the traffic.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: but it's safe it's a safe operation.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Because ʔuh one thing you could do is is turn the Caravan to forty.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: To get him across.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: And then just before you ship em send em back to fifty xxx something like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LANC: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Cause the track's what im- what's important.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: But but fifty was working out fine today.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: Fifteen degrees and a mile.
in,FALSE,TRUE,RAND: Is what you need so or less.
in,TRUE,FALSE,RAND: using visual.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: Yeah In fact it was a Was the West Coast that
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: was it the Horizon who said he could do the visual with the Twin Cesna ahead or was it vice versa one of the two.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: And at that point I said don't need it now.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LANC: They got it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Somebody in there?
in,FALSE,TRUE,LANC: I think Laura went in there yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BILL: Comm line for you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,BILL: XXX have a call on the other line.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: This is Randy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: Okay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,RAND: M_bye.
