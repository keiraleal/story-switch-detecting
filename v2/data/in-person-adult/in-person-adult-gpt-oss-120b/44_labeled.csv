in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: No: he doesn't
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He doesn't ca:ll really.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I don't
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: The only thing is like at at ho:me sometimes he likes to sit by me and stuff like.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I forgot to tell you look for the house with the reindeer.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You could find it a lot easier if you couldn't remember where we were.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh ⌈ really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: I always ⌉ remember at.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Once you get to it.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Once I see it I know oh that's it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: I'll look at some of the houses I'm like ooh is it this one is this one it and then I just
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Oh no that's the one.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Yeah the one with the two reindeer that Mark and Tim last year took and put on top of each other as if they were humping.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I was like-.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Neighbors are gonna see this so I went out in the morning I'm like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh Go:d.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: so I get out of my car stop in the driveway take em off of each other.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I was like I'll just kill them.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Those naughty boys.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But um mm no he just
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He he he's become mo:re atta:ched.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: and uh- I think a_lot_of it is because a_lot_of his friends have now gotten married and have children and he doesn't do as much with them.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I think that's why but he has gotten so: attached to me and it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I've always been very indepe:ndent and a_lot_of it had to do with like me growing up the way I did with my my um my mother dying.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: younger and then living with my one aunt and then my I- aunt died when I was twelve and then moving to another aunt which was moving up he:re and I I've always had to go ba:ck and forth I've always traveled on my own I've always flown everywhere by myself uh I've always done everything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I've had to deal with my fa:ther I- I'd listen to my sister when my nephew started college how she was saying she filled out all of his applications for where he was go:ing and she did all of these things when he had to apply for a scholarship or whatever she filled out everything and I'm like I did it by myse:lf you read the form and you fill it out.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Wo:w.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No one did it for me: you know and I was very ʔuh much whatever I needed I I got my money from my fa:ther he paid for schoo:l but I did everything on my own.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I I didn't ha:ve anyone.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: See my parents weren't very: I don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: They're not extremely educated and they're not really on top of things and so when it came to things like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: they w:ouldn't know how to help me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Really.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yeah they wouldn't
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I mean they had no clue they didn't give me any suggestions of where to go to school they said oh yeah go to school we'll pay for it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: We want you to go to school.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: But they had no idea of you know what's a good school what's a bad school: you know any type of di⌈rection?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ⌊ Se
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh ʔuh Yeah ⌋.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: They didn't give me anything like that ⌉.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: and see I f:eel that's one of the biggest setbacks.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I I see this with with bla:ck youths today is that becau:se your generations in the pa:st were not educated.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: you have a harder time deciding on what's a good school what's a good curriculum for you to ta:ke your your parents aren't able to talk to you about it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: W- just as you were saying even though you're not black but you were just saying that but black children have that even more so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Because you har
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: You're you're more likely not to be ha- come from educated parents.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Whereas I came from an educated family it was just the fact they made us do everything on our ow:n.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: but ʔuh black people also: th- those that have more tried to teach you to be stro:nger.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But I think they instilled s- tried m- tried to make me so strong that they forgo:t that I was a person.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I mean like I I often feel like at times that and maybe it's the gayness coming out in me but I don't like it like and when I was ho:me just went home to Indiana.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I went to hug my sister and I still feel that she finds a coldness in hugging.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: She doesn't like to hug.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: My family's not very much h:ugging.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean my whole life we've never been very you greet someone you don't s- hug them.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You're just like hi how are you and even like male female.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: You don't do it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: See uh my my mother was like that more so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: And then my f:ather was d:ifferent.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Very emotional?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Very hugging?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Yeah very hugging they were just
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: See my family is more.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: it's it's different.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: It's like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: ʔuh: each member of the family is s:lightly different and different a- amount of touch.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I always sai:d that if I had children I would always
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Especially if I had a son I would hug him just so he knew that I loved him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Ri:ght.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: I think it's important I think it's good.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: I don't think you can overly hug um with family and stuff like that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: See and that's how I feel is that I want to hug him because I want him to know that I do love him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And that I I I want my children if I if I ever ha:d children to know: tha:t there is nothing wro:ng with showing physical affection between two men.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: It doesn't make you gay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You know and tha:t is one of the things that Scott was saying yesterday it really bothered Scott a lot because his nephew uh kept calling him Aunt Sco:tt.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Because and his nephew was just being rude and obnoxious about every gift he he unwrapped and his brother said oh that's just the way kids are today and I'm like no that's the way you train your kids.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: If you don't train your kids to be any better then they are and see and in Scott's family like his brother his older brother'll say oh Scott's my best friend.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: But he'll tease Scott about- oh why aren't you married.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You know you must be a fa:g.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Or this and he'll lau:gh it off and he doesn't realize well yeah Scott i:s gay and it hurts Scott.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He doe:sn't know that he's gay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Has no idea.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He's probably he's gonna drop him off which is why I have to close those blinds soon.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Bu:t uh it it's the way he is:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And his brother is just like that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And so: he: and h- and so his little boy is growing up the same way.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Larry's twelve.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And he:'s like this big kid cause he's overweight.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I told Scott I said well Scott I wouldn't take it personal cause Scott was telling me this morning I said first of all Larry's twelve years old he's like six foot one and he's fat.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean he's just probably a good two hundred fifty pounds I said.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He's six one?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: At twelve?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: At twelve years old.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh that's scary.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he's like two hundred and fifty pounds.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I said Scott he's compensating for the fact I said I bet you the kids pick on him I said he's different.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I said so therefore: he probably is a big bully at school.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said so he's probably just like this kid who's just like rea:l bitter because nobody
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I said his dad is just an a a jerk Scott's brother will call our hou:se and just is just rude to Scott But yet he'll turn around and ask Scott to borrow five thousand dollars.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean like he just borrowed five thousand dollars from Scott like two years ago and told Scott oh I'll give it back I'm gonna invest it and I'll give it back in three months.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So he gives Scott
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: It takes him instead a year and a half to pay Scott back.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Like w- Scott's got five thousand dollars just to lay around.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Like that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You know and that's the way his brother is.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: You know very and he's just he's just mea:n to Scott.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He says things to Scott just like oh: just awful things about gay: and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well why doesn't Scott say something.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Because Scott hasn't dealt with his gayness himself and he hasn't dealt with who he is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And that's why he doesn't say anything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: So you can't really blame the guy in the sense that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: he doesn't know he's hurting him?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: If Scott doesn't stick up for himself.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I keep telling Scott.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: you're gonna have to say something.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Because all of these things are hurting you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yeah:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And Scott's like oh it doesn't bother me and I'm like then why are you talking about it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I said i- if that would have been my nephew and he would have said that to me I'd ve knocked him across that chair I don't care how ⌈ big he was.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: ⌊.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh: % laugh ʔuh ⌉.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh yeah: ⌋.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh I said my nephews d
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: My nephews and nieces do no:t one of the little gi:rls.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: f- uh tried pulling something on
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: We went shopping and tried the little attitude in the in the mall.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I grabbed her and I said I don't care if you are my sister's child I will knock you across that bench in a second.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I said I don't have to take that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I % laugh just it's
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You will never go shopping with me again.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Um I just don't believe in it and I I I'm sorry I was not hit as a child but I also was n:ot nasty like some kids now?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He's right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: They do talk bad.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Some of the kids say things but kids always do bu:t that's not an excu:se.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Exactly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Hello?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Hello:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: What's wro:ng.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: It's Jimmy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔWhy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Why?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh % laugh ʔuh % laugh Okay alright.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Wel
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: If you don't have enough gas and you're worried that you're gonna run out I wouldn't go anywhere ei:ther.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So why don't you call
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I'll call you later on.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Okay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Bye.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ENV: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He's afraid that he's gonna run out of gas getting over here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well why doesn't he get ga:s.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I don't know he drove all the way back from Green Bay with just on that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he thought he was ʔgonna ʔlike make it and somebody would be open and I'm like so he said he's like it's
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He said it's like past empty it's past the E: and so he's afrai:d that he'll run out on his way over here- and he probably would.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well he should just go to a gas station.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So he said he'll
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Well there's one down the street from his house but it'll probably be open tomorrow morning.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: It's not open now.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So he said he'd just rather stay home.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Instead and I said fi:ne go ahead and stay home.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But I don't know I I really think that it it's hard.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: it's hard it's it is hard having to hi:de this like Scott's doing I couldn't hide it any longer than he has he's hiding it way too long.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yea:h.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: No I couldn't hide it that long either.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: I told my mother when I had like my boyfriend moved away.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: She s
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Is that why you told her?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Cause I was really upset.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And then I s
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: An:d then she's like well it's a good thing he moved away cause he was sort of effeminate and I was really offended.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: That's how she took it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yea:h.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I was really offended cause she said something like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: well it's a good thing he was sort of weird I didn't like you hanging around him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I said what do you mean he was weird.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And she said he was sort of effeminate.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I was like well what do you mean he's gay: or something she's like well I think he might have been.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I said well: ʔuh why does that bother you?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I said because I am.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: And she's like no:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: You're not.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I know you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You're not gay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: And I said yes I am.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: I said how do you know me: better than I know myself: % laugh.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: And she's just looking at me and she was like really upset.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Did she tell your dad or did you tell your dad.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: No she ended up telling him I think eventually but not right away.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: First thing I had to go to see ʔa: a psychiatrist.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Oh she made you go do that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm I went.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Oh Jim's mother told him that too.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: See and then I went and the guy:'s like really nice and he's like well what what's why are you here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: tell me what's what's going on.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I said well:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: How old were you at this time.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Nineteen.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And she said that's for the psychiatrist at nineteen?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: She didn't think you knew: enough about yourself at that age?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Well she didn't wa:nt to believe it you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I guess you can't blame em some to some extent.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: So then I: went to the psychiatrist and he's like well what's the problem and I said well my mother's upset because I'm gay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: And he's like well it sounds like she has a problem then % laugh ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Did he really say that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Ye⌉:s.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He said it sounds like that- she's the one with the problem.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And I didn't even th:ink about how I s:aid it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I just said it?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You know?
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: And he interpreted w- how I said it as how it wa:s.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: You know w- which is true:.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And you know what's really f:unny is that a psychiatrist would say that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: and knowingly know: that you know he: accepted the fact that yes you are gay that it is something that like when Mike told his friend Julia Mike was telling me that Julia said oh I don't li:ke it but if that's what you want maybe that's not truly who you are:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know and I said to Mike I said then Mike she didn't accept it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: A:nd he sai:d well I think she accepted it she just said that and he told her that he feels he was bo:rn with it and she said no I don't believe that I think it's your choice that that's what you want.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said to
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I and I told Mike I said you know I hate when people say that because if I felt that was my choice I don't think that would've been the first choice I would've picked.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh % laugh Go:d no.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And it's not to say that I'm ash:a:med of being gay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: No:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh what it is: is that because of what society has do:ne or has laid the ru:les for us I don't really think I would have chose to be gay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I I wouldn't.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Why would I want to be gay and have to deal with what we go through.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Exa:ctly.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And that's what I explained to my f:olks now and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: and they: ʔuh totally believe that it's.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: like hereditary or genetic or whatever that it's not a choice.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You know because
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They do believe it now?
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: They totally b
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Oh: I believe it's it's
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I don't know if it's hereditary?
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I do believe it's something.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: It's a ge:ne or it's something.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I I do:n't think
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I don't care what people say.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You- you are
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You do not choose.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: u:nh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I've known since I was: gosh probably: I can remember?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Four?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Five years old?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I remember that.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Yeah.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I remember: looking a:t my uncle was sleeping on the couch in our family room an:d he was sleeping there with his boxers on and his peepee fell out of his pants.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I just stood there and stared at it an:d I was
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I know it was a sexual arousement cause I can remember feeling sexually interested.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And so I was like four years old.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: So I knew then.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You you kno:w what you feel insi:de.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You you c- you can't
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I don't care what anybody says a- a- f- at four years old I pick
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I chose that?
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: That I liked what I saw I don't think so.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I don't think I knew at four years old that I could actually just say oh wow I wanna play with this guy.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I don't think so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And and if they say things like oh when I was maybe s:even I slept with my cousin Tommy who was probably twelve thirteen?
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: At the time and I slept with him no he was sixteen.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Shared a bed with him and he: uh: started fondling me and I enjoyed it and I fondled him back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I was like seven years old.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I I don't say that he did it to me he molested me or r- or raped me as people are saying now the older uncle generally I think these kids.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Hm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: not saying adults should've been more responsible my old cons- cousin should have been more responsible.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: and not played with a old child but he did.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: But I'm not gonna turn around and tell my aunt well gee your son molested me as a child.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Is he gay?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: He's not gay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Well we don't know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: A:ctually: I think he is.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He brought home a drag queen for Christmas last year.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: But at the time no.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: he ha
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Like when he turned two he got married and he had kids and stuff he has: kids which doesn't mean anything there are a_lot_of fags with kids but he: just is very that was what ha:ppened to me.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And and I don't blame my cousin it was just another awakening experience for me I mean there were several experiences when I was growing up I mean I remember watching one of our neighbors who was taking a shower and you could see right through his bedroom and he got out and he was naked.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I remember watching.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I remember being mesmerized by his body.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I was never really that mesmerized by a female's body as I was by a male's body and so.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: that's why I don't understand where uh they come up with this of it's your choice.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: It's no:t.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I I know that that's what I felt.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Well I remember when I was li
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I was like probably three or four.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: and I was wrestling on the- I th- I remember wrestling on the floor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: with my brothers and being aroused.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Just like goofing around and stuff like that?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: And then I think the l
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: ʔThe experience when I was younger and my ʔuh:older brothers had friends over.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: I remember the f
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He he he come over with these friends with these guys and I would just be like in lust.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: For % laugh these % laugh guys I mean I must have been like nine or ten and I was just like idolizing these guys.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Like oh: my Go:d wow: I remember I would like imagine like if I could have them in my bedroom.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: See th- yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: That type of thing.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You know of- oh if
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Mhm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Li- as if they were like a to:y or something.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: That was my older brother because my older brother:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: uh: played football at Perdue.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: and I used to go to games and I followed him around he'd take me for weekends and then I'd get to sit in the locker room.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And these guys would like tickle me: and hug me and I was just a little kid.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Cause I probably
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Mm I was probably about ten at the time ten eleven and they: just thought I was the ni:cest little boy and I just had and I knew it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I was always sexually aroused by it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And you know these things and you know it's ins:ide of you.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: A:nd.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: you know what what do you do.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I know my brother who lives in Dallas uh the one that played football at Perdue he
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He knew it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He he knew he knew especially after Ron because when I left California I didn't come back here first I actually went to Dallas.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Because my brother's like come and stay with me: things'll work ou:t and you can look for a job down here.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: A:nd so: Ron f:lew to Dallas and went to my brother's house and banged on the door and said I want to see him we need to talk and my brother's like this is really odd for two friends to be this emotionally atta:ched.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I was like crying all the time and like when Ron came I started to- crying and I was just like just tell him to leave me alone just get him out of here and blah blah blah and.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh my Go:d.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Now you tell me your family doesn't realize now what is wrong that two friends a:re:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Having a.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Th- a thing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They're fighting each other: th- one guy's standing outside the house at midnight screaming let me talk to him let me talk to him it is a little weird.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know so.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Yeah I think they would figure that one out.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah and my brother had met Ron cause we went down there on a vacation of spring break once and he thought we- he was really cool and stuff so he really liked him a lo:t until that episode and then uh I haven't spoke to my brother to be honest with you since.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Really?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Why.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: W- was he like upset?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh No: h- I th:ink I'm afraid.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I'm afraid that he's gonna come right out and ask me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: about it and what happened was I ended up leaving Dallas and coming back to Wisconsin like a week later.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: But doesn't he come up here ever?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: For holidays at all or anything?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I won't go home when he's here.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Are you serious?
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I won't go to Indiana ʔuh see I don't have any family in Wisconsin.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: My family's all in Indiana.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So when he comes home like if I know he's coming home for Thanksgiving I won't go home.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He did call me one time because he needed me to se- sign a property agreement some property we own jointly.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mhm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: My
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: There's eight of us that my grandparents left us and he needed to borrow money against it.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So he called and left me a message I wasn't home I was working a:nd he said ga:ve me his number and told me to call him ba:ck and I called my sister and said fine send me the p
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Tell him to send me the paper and I'll sign it and I never talked to him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So I haven't talked to my b:rother see I've been in Milwaukee for ten years: s:o about ten and a half years.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Wo:w.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: How old is he.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He's a lot older than I am cause if I was ten and he was nineteen so he's nine years older than me?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So he's
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He's older he's in his forties.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He's in his forties.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Don't you think it's it's more that you were just- nervous at the time.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Well now I'm gonna tell him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I've t- I keep telling myself every month call him and just tell him because I wanna go to Dallas and I wanna
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I I miss my brother.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He was my best friend- and he knows.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He: knows.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But I just couldn't just come right out and tell him then.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I couldn't tell him wel
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: There was more to it than that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Ron came to the house he had a gu:n they had to call the poli:ce:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He had a gu:n:?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yes:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And he was standing outside the house saying I'm gonna
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I'm gonna kill myself if you don't talk to me just tell me a:nd th
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: There was just so much to this who:le.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: This is the guy who doesn't know he's gay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: Or: isn't sure if he's gay.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yes.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yes.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Who's now in the air force and lives in th- in South Carolina.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔSo.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Wait a second.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: I thought this w- guy was go- was married.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Ron.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Ron he's married right?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: That's Darren.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh: I'm thinking of Darren right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No Darren's: the other guy that was also in a frat that I knew in college the one that I told.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh those frat boys are too much.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I know.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He was the one that I told that if he'd had told me he loved me I would have never left Washington and moved with Ron.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I would have stuck with Darren.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I would have n:ever.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Cause I never really like I said Ron was my friend.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I knew Ron was my friend.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: A:nd I was in love with Darren.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: When I was in college and to this d:ay if Scott wasn't here and Darren wasn't married to a woman I would be with Darren.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He was probably the best s:exual partner I ʔuh could ever imagine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh my God.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And we never had sex.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He's the only person I know who kissed me when h- when he kissed me I just came right on the spot.
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You never had sex.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: N:ot you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Not the booty dance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ⌈.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: The booty dance.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ⌉ ʔuh: % laugh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Wo:w.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: We: had u:m.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: You had oral sex.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Oral sex:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But he: was just oh and fi:ne.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I don't like men with like auburn hair.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But he had auburn hair and these turquoise eyes and he was like six foot and just oh and he still is.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I was just like he is to die: for.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I thought why
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I was so young then and so stupid.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He was the one that blamed me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: he wouldn't speak to me for six months the first time we messed around we were drunk.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And we messed around.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he wouldn't speak to me for six months and said it was my fault that he knows he's not gay.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But yet he was the one that grabbed me and threw me on the floor.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: He confronted you and said that to you?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And got on top of me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I called him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: the next day after it had happened.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he said I don't want to talk to you you took advantage of me when I was drunk.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But he's the one that grabbed me kissed me took my underwear off a:nd he started it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know I knew: what I was about.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I didn't get into it but I knew.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And he was the one that was the first experience.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And then the second experience he didn't speak to me for three months ʔuh because he blamed me for that.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And then: the third experience he blamed me for he's been blaming me for all of these experiences up unti:l uh: li:ke Scott and I got serious like the year after and I was still k:ind of seeing Darren I went out to Washington and stuff and that's when he sto:pped blaming me.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Now: he calls me and tells me that he wants to be with me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he called
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Like he called me last week and said he wanted to be with me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: You're kidding.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: But he's married to Lauren.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I keep telling him get out of that relationship before you have children.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Just get out of it don't carry any by- baggage with you.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Always my biggest theory.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Don't carry any excess baggage.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm:.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: With you.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And he lo:ves her.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: But what he doesn't know how to separate is he loves her but he's not in love with her.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: You know what I mean ⌈ he he just
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: ⌊ Right right.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh ⌋ yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ⌉.
in,TRUE,FALSE,CAM: you can love a person but you're not in love with them.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: It's not sexual.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And that's really har:d.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Becau:se.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: you you find it very difficult to be to love someone and when you tell someone you love them they misunderstand what love is all about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So I don't know.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But I d- I I think if there was ever anybody I truly
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But he k
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He: everybody has that one person who breaks their heart and he broke my heart.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Just incredibly because I wasn't really in love with his looks I: just I've never met anybody who when you they touched you just there was so much warmth.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And so much just
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: There was so much energy there.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Tha:t I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: So you've kept in contact with him?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuh Mm yes:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Since nineteen
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: That's amazing.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I've been here for all this time.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: What does he just call or you call when he's
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He calls me.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: I can't call him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Actually I can cause his wife knows that we're friends.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: But I don't choose to call him.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Like he used to travel around the country.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: they live
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They used to live in Valencia California.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: now they live somewhere they just moved cause his wife got a new job.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He quit his job for her for her: job.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Cause she moved to California for them cause they were living in Washington DC.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: So he used to travel all around the world.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Well whenever he come to Wisconsin for the dairy expo or he'd come here go to Chicago for some reason to take businessmen around what he did was ʔuh he took f:- uh farmers around from arou- different parts of the world so that they can look at farms.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So his travel a_lot_of times was in Wisconsin because of the farms here.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They would see how: things were done and he
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He like took them around the world.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know doing this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he traveled all over the world.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: See tha:t's why I think Darren no:w is getting to this point where he's with Lauren all the ti:me.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And before Darren traveled like ninety percent of the year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He was gone.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean Darren was gone ninety percent of the year.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So now he's with Lauren ev:ery day and it's been this way for the last three or four months.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I think k
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh that's all?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: For the last three or four months?
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He just started stop
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They've been married six years.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He just stopped traveling.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh:?
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I think now it's just like I don't know if this is for me I don't know if this is right and he's starting to call me.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And he's starting to tell me how much he cares for me and how he has feelings for me and I
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I know that you're with Scott.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I'm just li:ke and I'm not giving up my life for you.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He asked me once right out of college when he moved to Washington DC when I came back from California and I was here and I had just started working he asked me to move to Madison.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: To be with him.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: That was when he was on the peak of thinking maybe I am gay.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said well: why don't I come out there first and we'll see.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So I went out there and he goes well yeah you can move out here and get your own apartment whereas he owned a bedroom hou:se and lived by himself and I'm like okay can I afford to move out here get a apartment until I fi:nd
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He never said move in here with me until you find a place or whatever.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: It was just li:ke and then he wanted the still straight life and this and that and other.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So now he claims bisexuality but he's moving closer I think to steps of being gay because when he was talking to me on the phone last week he was telling me how much he still loved me.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And he doesn't know what to do about this whole situation.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: How could he really love you though he doesn't know you that much.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: He doesn't know me because in the last ten years we talked to each other maybe once a month.
in,FALSE,TRUE,CAM: Well that's quite a bit though.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And actually maybe not even that.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Sometimes it's every other month.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: When he was traveling around the world like he went to Germany for six weeks.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he sent me his frequent flyer ticket.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Cause he was there training to t- speak learning to speak German in a week course.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he sent me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: a free- k- to- to come and spend a week with him and I said no.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: But at that time I would- been with Scott like four years and I was just like I don't think so.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You're not gonna use me for your little sex thing for that week and then that's it so I mean I st- I love him I really do but.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Hm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I don't
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I also don't trust him.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I don't think any man who is as sexual as he w- is ʔuh and traveled as much as he did could stay celibate or- or stay t- t- committed to his wi:fe.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Right.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean when y- I saw him once in Chicago I went to Chicago.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: About four years ago?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Five years ago?
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: A:nd he was in Chicago in this really nice hotel and he said why don't you come and you know I:'m free Saturday and Sunday.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Why don't you come.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said fine.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So I took the train to Chicago on Saturday and I thought okay no big deal he'll have a room with two double beds.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No it was a size bed.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So I thought okay no big deal I took a sleeping bag just in case.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So here I am taking my sleeping bag I roll it out on the floor and he goes ʔuh well you don't have to worry you can share this bed with me I love Lauren and
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: No: I take that back.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: It was more than five years ago because he's been married to Lauren for six years this coming May no.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Seven years this coming May.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So it was m:ore than six years ago because it was when he asked Lauren to marry him it was right around Christmas time.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: So it's been about six and a half years so he asked Lauren to marry him and he says I really love Lauren X I'm gonna marry her and blah blah blah this.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So I get in the bed I thought fine no big deal.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: I'm wearing my shirt and my underwear so I get in the bed and in the morning I wake up and here he is fondling me.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: So I'm like okay so do you leave or what do you do.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: You know so ʔuh I'm like Darren ʔuh he goes just don't say anything.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said Darren this isn't right you don't really want to be with me you just want the sexual part.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I said that's all there is to it and I just can't do this.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he accepted it and I I don't know:
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: He always and he'll always ask me well how's Scott how is your sex life with Sco:tt.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: Are you happy with Scott you know do you still miss me.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And I'm like well Darren I haven't told you I missed you in years.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: What are you talking about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know it's % laugh like k- excuse me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: ʔuhʔuh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: ʔuh Is he like full of himself or what.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And he's another one too.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He knows he's looking.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: He he's another one.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: When we were were in college he knew it.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: And and what really gets me is th- ʔuh that I think the reason I always attra:cted like I attracted a_lot_of football players is people always got the impression I was gay:.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: So if they knew you were gay: and they wanted some experience and they they didn't want to approach another say man in your fra:t.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And they kinda thou:ght you were gay: and nobody really wanted to like say it they would approach me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So I always got all the looking ones to always like come after me.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm:.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And that's how I ended up with Ron and how I ended up with Darren.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And I and I realize that you know I always think well especially Ron.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I mean he: was just like oh just perfect.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Well Darren was too but Darren a_lot_of people don't like auburn hair or reddish brown hair.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They don't ca- care for it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: But Ron just is just a
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: just a beautiful man.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They both were but I find that that's what happens in these fraternities.
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: Is you find a man who is curious about his sexuality.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: And if they find someone who they question okay is he gay or isn't he gay then they will tend to go after you a little bit faster.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: So then you think okay you've seen some of these guys in the bars and you think like I was out at the Triangle and I saw this guy he was so: looking I'm like.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: .
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: how the hell did he end up with that thi:ng.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And then I thought you know I betcha he's just out
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: And he was from Marquette and he was just finding out and he met this guy: and that's why he was out with him.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh::.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: You know I mean.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: When was this.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: it
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: This was probab
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: This was a while back.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: This was
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: They young?
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Well the w
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Oh.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: They were young.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: The one guy in particular was young.
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: The guy that was from Marquette.
out,FALSE,FALSE,CAM: Mm.
out,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: Was probably I f
in,FALSE,FALSE,LAJU: I wouldn't think he would be more than twenty one I couldn't
in,FALSE,TRUE,LAJU: But he shouldn't have been in the Triangle if you want to know the truth.
in,TRUE,FALSE,LAJU: So: but um: no: he was just very ni:ce.
out,FALSE,FALSE,@End
