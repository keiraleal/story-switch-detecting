in,FALSE,FALSE,JON: ⌊ To give him the machine.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: ⌋.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: because I'd say ⌉ probably it wasn't Like it was like computers.

out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: True story.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: It was a true story.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: I I
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: Well it would've cost you that to replace the doggone machine?
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: Aw I'd ve had to replace it for the store uh but as I said it was only a matter of I guess a year those things were really antiquated-.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALAN: Although we used em a lot.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: Uh in those days and I you know I recorded the whole trip and uh you know things that we did It was a wonderful trip we had good times.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: Better than keeping a diary?
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: Oh yeah.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: A lot easier.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: It really is.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: Uh.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: We
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: I keep a
in,TRUE,FALSE,JON: Remember we tried keeping a diary on the China trip and man it was arduous.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: Well I keep a diary
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALAN: course I we we haven't traveled much lately I keep a diary when I go out of the country.
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: Still got em in here.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALAN: Otherwise my problem is and it's a lot easier to do it that way but I I keep I diary when I go out of the country.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: .
in,FALSE,TRUE,ALAN: The problem is ʔuh: with me not that it comes up too much but someone'll say something to me about somewhere I s- Shit I I you know I I forgot where I went.
in,TRUE,FALSE,ALAN: I have to look cause I can't remember.
in,FALSE,TRUE,JON: Well you go to so many places on a cruise particularly you know.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: Yeah.
in,TRUE,FALSE,JON: So many places in a short time that you get em mixed up.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JON: Now we can't even keep our photos straight without the diary.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: Oh yeah.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: Well you know y- when you get back from your trip until you make another trip you can remember.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: But having taken as many trips as you've taken shit they sorta run together.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: I'm talking about.
out,FALSE,FALSE,JON: They do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: the ones that were fi:ve years ago.
in,FALSE,FALSE,JON: Honest they do.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: to separate the trip that you went on this one f
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: It's tough to do.
out,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: And uh but they're a lot
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: that's a lot easier than a diary then you can transcribe it.
in,FALSE,FALSE,ALAN: But uh I don't take I don't take my diary in the domestic United States and we haven't traveled all that much but I have taken em uh: first trip I made ʔuh you know o- out XXX In six.
