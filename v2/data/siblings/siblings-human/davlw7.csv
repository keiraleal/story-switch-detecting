out,FALSE,FALSE,"@Comment: MOT asked Chi if he wanted to read the book first , and then he suggested she read it , so Mot read the book out loud. Mot then prompted Chi in how to start off the letter. Throughout the task , MOT suggested sentences for Chi to use in his letter , which he used. He came up with a few ideas on his own. Mot helped with spelling , grammar , punctuation , and capitalization. She also commented on how nice his cursive writing was. Chi's younger brother was present during the task and talked either to Mot and Chi or to himself throughout the whole task. (letter was not available; see end of task for Chi's reading of his letter)"
